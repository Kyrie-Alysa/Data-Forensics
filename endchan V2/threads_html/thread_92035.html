  <div class="divMessage">Acts 7:<br>39 ‚ÄúBut our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt. 40 They told Aaron, ‚ÄòMake us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt‚Äîwe don‚Äôt know what has happened to him!‚Äô[i] 41 That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and reveled in what their own hands had made. 42 But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun, moon and stars. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets:<br><br>‚Äú‚ÄòDid you bring me sacrifices and offerings<br>forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel?<br>43 You have taken up the tabernacle of Molek<br>and the star of your god Rephan,<br>the idols you made to worship.<br>Therefore I will send you into exile‚Äô[j] beyond Babylon.<br><br>44 ‚ÄúOur ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the wilderness. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen. 45 After receiving the tabernacle, our ancestors under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David, 46 who enjoyed God‚Äôs favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.[k] 47 But it was Solomon who built a house for him.<br><br>48 ‚ÄúHowever, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says:<br><br>49 ‚Äú‚ÄòHeaven is my throne,<br>and the earth is my footstool.<br>What kind of house will you build for me?<br>says the Lord.<br>Or where will my resting place be?<br>50 Has not my hand made all these things?‚Äô[l]<br><br>51 ‚ÄúYou stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit!</div>

Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven. 16 Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.<br><br>17 Elijah was a human being, even as we are. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years. 18 Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.<br><br>19 My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, 20 remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Romans 7:
<br>Released From the Law, Bound to Christ
<br>1 Do you not know, brothers and sisters‚Äîfor I am speaking to those who know the law‚Äîthat the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives? 2 For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him. 3 So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.
<br>
<br>4 So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God. 5 For when we were in the realm of the flesh,[a] the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death. 6 But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.
<br>
<br>The Law and Sin
<br>7 What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, ‚ÄúYou shall not covet.‚Äù[b] 8 But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin was dead. 9 Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. 10 I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. 11 For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death. 12 So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good. 13 Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! Nevertheless, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
<br>
<br>14 We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 17 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 18 For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature.[c] For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19 For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do‚Äîthis I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.
<br>
<br>21 So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22 For in my inner being I delight in God‚Äôs law; 23 but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? 25 Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!
<br>
<br>So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God‚Äôs law, but in my sinful nature[d] a slave to the law of sin.</div>

<br>1 Follow God‚Äôs example, therefore, as dearly loved children 2 and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
<br>
<br>3 But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God‚Äôs holy people. 4 Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. 5 For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person‚Äîsuch a person is an idolater‚Äîhas any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.[a] 6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God‚Äôs wrath comes on those who are disobedient. 7 Therefore do not be partners with them.

Live as children of light 9 (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) 10 and find out what pleases the Lord. 11 Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. 12 It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. 13 But everything exposed by the light becomes visible‚Äîand everything that is illuminated becomes a light. 14 This is why it is said:
<br>
<br>‚ÄúWake up, sleeper,
<br>    rise from the dead,
<br>    and Christ will shine on you.‚Äù
<br>
<br>15 Be very careful, then, how you live‚Äînot as unwise but as wise, 16 making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. 17 Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord‚Äôs will is. 18 Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit, 19 speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, 20 always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Instructions for Christian Households
<br>21 Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
<br>
<br>22 Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
<br>
<br>25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26 to make her holy, cleansing[b] her by the washing with water through the word, 27 and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church‚Äî 30 for we are members of his body. 31 ‚ÄúFor this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.‚Äù[c] 32 This is a profound mystery‚Äîbut I am talking about Christ and the church. 33 However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</div>

<br>Judgment and Salvation
<br>1 ‚ÄúI revealed myself to those who did not ask for me;
<br>    I was found by those who did not seek me.
<br>To a nation that did not call on my name,
<br>    I said, ‚ÄòHere am I, here am I.‚Äô
<br>2 All day long I have held out my hands
<br>    to an obstinate people,

<br>3 a people who continually provoke me

<br>offering sacrifices in gardens
<br>    and burning incense on altars of brick;
<br>4 who sit among the graves
<br>    and spend their nights keeping secret vigil;
<br>who eat the flesh of pigs,
<br>    and whose pots hold broth of impure meat;
<br>5 who say, ‚ÄòKeep away; don‚Äôt come near me,
<br>    for I am too sacred for you!‚Äô
<br>Such people are smoke in my nostrils,

<br>    I will pay it back into their laps‚Äî
<br>7 both your sins and the sins of your ancestors,‚Äù
<br>    says the Lord.

  <div class="divMessage">8 This is what the Lord says:
<br>
<br>‚ÄúAs when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes
<br>    and people say, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt destroy it,
<br>    there is still a blessing in it,‚Äô
<br>so will I do in behalf of my servants;
<br>    I will not destroy them all.
<br>9 I will bring forth descendants from Jacob,
<br>    and from Judah those who will possess my mountains;
<br>my chosen people will inherit them,
<br>    and there will my servants live.
<br>10 Sharon will become a pasture for flocks,
<br>    and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds,
<br>    for my people who seek me.
<br>
<br>11 ‚ÄúBut as for you who forsake the Lord
<br>    and forget my holy mountain,
<br>who spread a table for Fortune
<br>    and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,
<br>12 I will destine you for the sword,
<br>    and all of you will fall in the slaughter;
<br>for I called but you did not answer,
<br>    I spoke but you did not listen.
<br>You did evil in my sight
<br>    and chose what displeases me.‚Äù
<br>
<br>13 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says:
<br>
<br>‚ÄúMy servants will eat,
<br>    but you will go hungry;
<br>my servants will drink,
<br>    but you will go thirsty;
<br>my servants will rejoice,
<br>    but you will be put to shame.
<br>14 My servants will sing
<br>    out of the joy of their hearts,
<br>but you will cry out
<br>    from anguish of heart
<br>    and wail in brokenness of spirit.
<br>15 You will leave your name
<br>    for my chosen ones to use in their curses;
<br>the Sovereign Lord will put you to death,
<br>    but to his servants he will give another name.
<br>16 Whoever invokes a blessing in the land
<br>    will do so by the one true God;
<br>whoever takes an oath in the land
<br>    will swear by the one true God.
<br>For the past troubles will be forgotten
<br>    and hidden from my eyes.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Mark 2:
<br>Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man
<br>1 A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. 2 They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them. 3 Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them. 4 Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. 5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, ‚ÄúSon, your sins are forgiven.‚Äù
<br>
<br>6 Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, 7 ‚ÄúWhy does this fellow talk like that? He‚Äôs blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?‚Äù
<br>
<br>8 Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, ‚ÄúWhy are you thinking these things? 9 Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, ‚ÄòYour sins are forgiven,‚Äô or to say, ‚ÄòGet up, take your mat and walk‚Äô? 10 But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.‚Äù So he said to the man, 11 ‚ÄúI tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.‚Äù 12 He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, ‚ÄúWe have never seen anything like this!‚Äù
<br>
<br>Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Sinners
<br>13 Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them. 14 As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector‚Äôs booth. ‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
<br>
<br>15 While Jesus was having dinner at Levi‚Äôs house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. 16 When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: ‚ÄúWhy does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?‚Äù
<br>
<br>17 On hearing this, Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúIt is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.‚Äù</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Jesus Questioned About Fasting
<br>18 Now John‚Äôs disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, ‚ÄúHow is it that John‚Äôs disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?‚Äù
<br>
<br>19 Jesus answered, ‚ÄúHow can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. 20 But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.
<br>
<br>21 ‚ÄúNo one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse. 22 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins.‚Äù
<br>
<br>Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath
<br>23 One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain. 24 The Pharisees said to him, ‚ÄúLook, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?‚Äù
<br>
<br>25 He answered, ‚ÄúHave you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? 26 In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.‚Äù
<br>
<br>27 Then he said to them, ‚ÄúThe Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. 28 So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.‚Äù</div>

  <div class="divMessage">1 Timothy 2:
<br>Instructions on Worship
<br>1 I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people‚Äî 2 for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. 3 This is good, and pleases God our Savior, 4 who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. 5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, 6 who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time. 7 And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle‚ÄîI am telling the truth, I am not lying‚Äîand a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.
<br>
<br>8 Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing. 9 I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, 10 but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.
<br>
<br>11 A woman[a] should learn in quietness and full submission. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man;[b] she must be quiet. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14 And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 15 But women[c] will be saved through childbearing‚Äîif they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.</div>

<br>The Jews are very often the Chicken they themselves strike against a wall. You could whine all day about how Jews own all the pornography websites but we must blame ourselves for buying into it, watching it and financially supporting it. There's two sides to a coin. There's always gonna be another jew to buy up Mindgeek if the head is eliminated. Discourage your own brothers and sisters from watching, liking and commenting supporting messages on the posts of whores instead. Jesus Christ, on another note, is God in the Flesh. His ethnicity matters little, to me at least, as What He Preached and Died for is of a far greater Concern and should be considered thoroughly for your own good. You'll do something actually productive if you went up to a whore's Twitter page right now and pointed out her sin instead of disregarding Jesus Christ because of His Race.</div>

<br>Proverbs 3:
<br>Wisdom Bestows Well-Being
<br>1 My son, do not forget my teaching,
<br>    but keep my commands in your heart,
<br>2 for they will prolong your life many years
<br>    and bring you peace and prosperity.
<br>
<br>3 Let love and faithfulness never leave you;
<br>    bind them around your neck,
<br>    write them on the tablet of your heart.
<br>4 Then you will win favor and a good name
<br>    in the sight of God and man.
<br>
<br>5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart
<br>    and lean not on your own understanding;
<br>6 in all your ways submit to him,
<br>    and he will make your paths straight.[a]
<br>
<br>7 Do not be wise in your own eyes;
<br>    fear the Lord and shun evil.
<br>8 This will bring health to your body
<br>    and nourishment to your bones.
<br>
<br>9 Honor the Lord with your wealth,
<br>    with the firstfruits of all your crops;
<br>10 then your barns will be filled to overflowing,
<br>    and your vats will brim over with new wine.
<br>
<br>11 My son, do not despise the Lord‚Äôs discipline,
<br>    and do not resent his rebuke,
<br>12 because the Lord disciplines those he loves,
<br>    as a father the son he delights in.
<br>13 Blessed are those who find wisdom,
<br>    those who gain understanding,
<br>14 for she is more profitable than silver
<br>    and yields better returns than gold.
<br>15 She is more precious than rubies;
<br>    nothing you desire can compare with her.
<br>16 Long life is in her right hand;
<br>    in her left hand are riches and honor.
<br>17 Her ways are pleasant ways,
<br>    and all her paths are peace.
<br>18 She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her;
<br>    those who hold her fast will be blessed.
<br>
<br>19 By wisdom the Lord laid the earth‚Äôs foundations,
<br>    by understanding he set the heavens in place;
<br>20 by his knowledge the watery depths were divided,
<br>    and the clouds let drop the dew.
<br>
<br>21 My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight,
<br>    preserve sound judgment and discretion;
<br>22 they will be life for you,
<br>    an ornament to grace your neck.
<br>23 Then you will go on your way in safety,
<br>    and your foot will not stumble.
<br>24 When you lie down, you will not be afraid;
<br>    when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
<br>25 Have no fear of sudden disaster
<br>    or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,
<br>26 for the Lord will be at your side
<br>    and will keep your foot from being snared.
<br>
<br>27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
<br>    when it is in your power to act.
<br>28 Do not say to your neighbor,
<br>    ‚ÄúCome back tomorrow and I‚Äôll give it to you‚Äù‚Äî
<br>    when you already have it with you.
<br>29 Do not plot harm against your neighbor,
<br>    who lives trustfully near you.
<br>30 Do not accuse anyone for no reason‚Äî
<br>    when they have done you no harm.
<br>
<br>31 Do not envy the violent
<br>    or choose any of their ways.
<br>
<br>32 For the Lord detests the perverse
<br>    but takes the upright into his confidence.
<br>33 The Lord‚Äôs curse is on the house of the wicked,
<br>    but he blesses the home of the righteous.
<br>34 He mocks proud mockers
<br>    but shows favor to the humble and oppressed.
<br>35 The wise inherit honor,
<br>    but fools get only shame.</div>

As said many times in the past here: The Codex Sinaiticus is the oldest hard evidence of the New Testament. The Septuagint is the oldest hard evidence of the Old Testament. They're both in Greek. So when kikes claim Hebrew was the origin - they're lying their asses off. Jesus spoke Aramaic. Not Hebrew. Celt tribes were assigned the prefix of Gal-. Scottish were Galedones. Irish were Gaels. Spaniards were Galicians. French were Gauls. The Palestinians, Galileans. Galib meant heathen to jews. This is why they called everyone else that. Galib-lee was "heathens' country". Judea was in the south between the Dead Sea and Negev Desert. Mary was Galilean.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/92035.html#92095">&gt;&gt;92095</a><br>Judeans weren't even the modern jews of today because they crossed the Caucasus mountains and converted Turkic Khazars. For any Christian to claim Jesus as jew is to reject the immaculate conception by claiming Mary never birthed Jesus from God but of Joseph. But you don't believe Joseph was the father do you? Then don't believe the lies of jews who seethe with hatred against Christianity.</div>

<br>To deny that Jesus Christ is born from the "Chosen Race" is to deny the Prophecy and Deny that Jesus Christ is God. Perhaps He is not the same Ethnicity as The Modern Jews since The Bible warns of False Jews who belong to the Synagogue of Satan but even in that regard, Your pleading is Meaningless. Jesus Christ came to Save both Jew and Gentile from Eternal Damnation. Concern yourself with Salvation and Abiding by the Law, not the Skin colour and nose width of your own brothers and sisters.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">I don't plead. I state facts. When you reject the Word in part, you should know full well the consequences stated at the very end of the Book of Revelation. I was raised as a Catholic, then a Lutheran, then a Protestant because my grandmother kept changing her mind. I know texts you have been displaying very well and I know the texts your flowery type typically rejects. Modern Christianity is no longer strong because you only want to preach the good words that do not judge. Other verses are kept from being sermonized in churches in order not to upset everyone. Bibles are re-translated with offensive text removed. Christians used to be warriors. Crusaders. Post Christ. This modern sappy nonsense of peace and love to all, when even the scripture states to punish evil. It's nothing short of insanity.<br><br>You allow this to happen through being deceived by the very enemy your own religion's text warns you about. You do not concern yourselves with change in current life because all you're focused on is the afterlife. Christian Zionists are literally promoting the genocide of Christian Palestinians as they're being deceived. Swallowing the manipulation of those who hate you so easily. This is why the religion is currently in the weak state it's in.</div>

Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul? 14 I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, 15 so no one can say that you were baptized in my name. 16 (Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don‚Äôt remember if I baptized anyone else.) 17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel‚Äînot with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.<br>Christ Crucified Is God‚Äôs Power and Wisdom<br>18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written:<br><br>‚ÄúI will destroy the wisdom of the wise;<br>    the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.‚Äù<br><br>20 Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22 Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23 but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24 but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.<br><br>26 Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 28 God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things‚Äîand the things that are not‚Äîto nullify the things that are, 29 so that no one may boast before him. 30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God‚Äîthat is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. 31 Therefore, as it is written: ‚ÄúLet the one who boasts boast in the Lord.‚Äù</div>

  <div class="divMessage">2 Corinthians 4:
<br>Present Weakness and Resurrection Life
<br>1 Therefore, since through God‚Äôs mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart. 2 Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone‚Äôs conscience in the sight of God. 3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. 4 The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 5 For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus‚Äô sake. 6 For God, who said, ‚ÄúLet light shine out of darkness,‚Äù made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God‚Äôs glory displayed in the face of Christ.
<br>
<br>7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. 8 We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; 9 persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. 10 We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. 11 For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus‚Äô sake, so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body. 12 So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.
<br>
<br>13 It is written: ‚ÄúI believed; therefore I have spoken.‚Äù Since we have that same spirit of faith, we also believe and therefore speak, 14 because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you to himself. 15 All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.
<br>
<br>16 Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. 17 For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. 18 So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">James 5:<br>Warning to Rich Oppressors<br>1 Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you. 2 Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. 3 Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. 4 Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. 5 You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter. 6 You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you.<br><br>Patience in Suffering<br>7 Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord‚Äôs coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains. 8 You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord‚Äôs coming is near. 9 Don‚Äôt grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door!<br><br>10 Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 11 As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job‚Äôs perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.<br><br>12 Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear‚Äînot by heaven or by earth or by anything else. All you need to say is a simple ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Otherwise you will be condemned.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">2 Peter 2:<br>False Teachers and Their Destruction<br>1 But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them‚Äîbringing swift destruction on themselves. 2 Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. 3 In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.<br><br>4 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment; 5 if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others; 6 if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; 7 and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless 8 (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)‚Äî 9 if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment. 10 This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh and despise authority.<br><br>Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings; 11 yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from the Lord. 12 But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like animals they too will perish.<br><br>13 They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you. 14 With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed‚Äîan accursed brood! 15 They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Bezer, who loved the wages of wickedness. 16 But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey‚Äîan animal without speech‚Äîwho spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet‚Äôs madness.<br><br>17 These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them. 18 For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error. 19 They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity‚Äîfor ‚Äúpeople are slaves to whatever has mastered them.‚Äù 20 If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. 21 It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them. 22 Of them the proverbs are true: ‚ÄúA dog returns to its vomit,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúA sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud.‚Äù</div>

As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you."<br><br>Ezekiel 20:13 "But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them."</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Ezekiel 20:27-32 "Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me. For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings. Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day. Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations? For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you."<br><br>Ezekiel 20:39 "As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols."<br><br>Ezekiel 21:1-5 "And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked. Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north: That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more."<br><br>Ezekiel 21:12 "Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh."<br><br>Ezekiel 21:25 "And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end"<br>Ezekiel 22:18 "Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver."<br><br>John 8:21-35 "Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. As he spake these words, many believed on him. Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever."</div>

  <div class="divMessage">John 8:36-45 "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. <strong>Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</strong> And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not."<br><br>Romans 11:8-12 "(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day. And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them: Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway. I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy. Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?"<br><br>Romans 11:25 "For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in."<br><br>Jeremiah 31:37 "Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD."<br><br>Matthew 23:37-39 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."<br><br>Acts 13:46-50 "Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region. But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts."<br><br>Matthew 27:20-23 "But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified."</div>

  <div class="divMessage">John 3:<br>Jesus Teaches Nicodemus<br>1 Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. 2 He came to Jesus at night and said, ‚ÄúRabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.‚Äù<br><br>3 Jesus replied, ‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.‚Äù<br><br>4 ‚ÄúHow can someone be born when they are old?‚Äù Nicodemus asked. ‚ÄúSurely they cannot enter a second time into their mother‚Äôs womb to be born!‚Äù<br><br>5 Jesus answered, ‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. 6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. 7 You should not be surprised at my saying, ‚ÄòYou must be born again.‚Äô 8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going.

  <div class="divMessage">John 19:
<br>Jesus Sentenced to Be Crucified
<br>1 Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. 2 The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe 3 and went up to him again and again, saying, ‚ÄúHail, king of the Jews!‚Äù And they slapped him in the face.
<br>
<br>4 Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, ‚ÄúLook, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.‚Äù 5 When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, ‚ÄúHere is the man!‚Äù
<br>
<br>6 As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, ‚ÄúCrucify! Crucify!‚Äù
<br>
<br>But Pilate answered, ‚ÄúYou take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.‚Äù
<br>
<br>7 The Jewish leaders insisted, ‚ÄúWe have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.‚Äù
<br>
<br>8 When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, 9 and he went back inside the palace. ‚ÄúWhere do you come from?‚Äù he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. 10 ‚ÄúDo you refuse to speak to me?‚Äù Pilate said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?‚Äù
<br>
<br>11 Jesus answered, ‚ÄúYou would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.‚Äù
<br>
<br>12 From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, ‚ÄúIf you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.‚Äù
<br>
<br>13 When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge‚Äôs seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). 14 It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon.
<br>
<br>‚ÄúHere is your king,‚Äù Pilate said to the Jews.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">John 14:
<br>Jesus Comforts His Disciples
<br>1 ‚ÄúDo not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. 2 My Father‚Äôs house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. 4 You know the way to the place where I am going.‚Äù
<br>
<br>Jesus the Way to the Father
<br>5 Thomas said to him, ‚ÄúLord, we don‚Äôt know where you are going, so how can we know the way?‚Äù
<br>
<br>6 Jesus answered, ‚ÄúI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7 If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.‚Äù
<br>
<br>8 Philip said, ‚ÄúLord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.‚Äù
<br>
<br>9 Jesus answered: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‚ÄòShow us the Father‚Äô? 10 Don‚Äôt you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. 11 Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves. 12 Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 13 And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.
<br>Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit
<br>15 ‚ÄúIf you love me, keep my commands. 16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever‚Äî 17 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. 18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. 19 Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. 20 On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. 21 Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.‚Äù
<br>
<br>22 Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, ‚ÄúBut, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?‚Äù
<br>
<br>23 Jesus replied, ‚ÄúAnyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. 24 Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.
<br>
<br>25 ‚ÄúAll this I have spoken while still with you. 26 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. 27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.
<br>
<br>28 ‚ÄúYou heard me say, ‚ÄòI am going away and I am coming back to you.‚Äô If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. 29 I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe. 30 I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me, 31 but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me.
<br>
<br>‚ÄúCome now; let us leave.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Matthew 27:
<br>The Death of Jesus
<br>45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, ‚ÄúEli, Eli, lema sabachthani?‚Äù that is, ‚ÄúMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?‚Äù 47 And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, ‚ÄúThis man is calling Elijah.‚Äù 48 And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. 49 But the others said, ‚ÄúWait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.‚Äù 50 And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.
<br>
<br>51 And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split. 52 The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, 53 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. 54 When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, ‚ÄúTruly this was the Son of God!‚Äù
<br>
<br>55 There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, 56 among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
<br>
<br>Jesus Is Buried
<br>57 When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. 58 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. 59 And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud 60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. 61 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.
<br>
<br>The Guard at the Tomb
<br>62 The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate 63 and said, ‚ÄúSir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, ‚ÄòAfter three days I will rise.‚Äô 64 Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, ‚ÄòHe has risen from the dead,‚Äô and the last fraud will be worse than the first.‚Äù 65 Pilate said to them, ‚ÄúYou have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.‚Äù 66 So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Matthew 28:
<br>Jesus Has Risen
<br>1 After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
<br>
<br>2 There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. 4 The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
<br>
<br>5 The angel said to the women, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‚ÄòHe has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.‚Äô Now I have told you.‚Äù
<br>
<br>8 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 Suddenly Jesus met them. ‚ÄúGreetings,‚Äù he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. 10 Then Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.‚Äù
<br>
<br>The Guards‚Äô Report
<br>11 While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. 12 When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, 13 telling them, ‚ÄúYou are to say, ‚ÄòHis disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.‚Äô 14 If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.‚Äù 15 So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.
<br>
<br>The Great Commission
<br>16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. 17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. 18 Then Jesus came to them and said, ‚ÄúAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.‚Äù</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Matthew 6:
<br>Giving to the Needy
<br>1 ‚ÄúBe careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
<br>
<br>2 ‚ÄúSo when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
<br>
<br>Prayer
<br>5 ‚ÄúAnd when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 6 But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 7 And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
<br>
<br>9 ‚ÄúThis, then, is how you should pray:
<br>
<br>‚Äú‚ÄòOur Father in heaven,
<br>hallowed be your name,
<br>10 your kingdom come,
<br>your will be done,
<br>    on earth as it is in heaven.
<br>11 Give us today our daily bread.
<br>12 And forgive us our debts,
<br>    as we also have forgiven our debtors.
<br>13 And lead us not into temptation,
<br>    but deliver us from the evil one.‚Äô
<br>
<br>14 For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.
<br>
<br>Fasting
<br>16 ‚ÄúWhen you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 17 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, 18 so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
<br>Treasures in Heaven
<br>19 ‚ÄúDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
<br>
<br>22 ‚ÄúThe eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. 23 But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
<br>
<br>24 ‚ÄúNo one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.
<br>
<br>Do Not Worry
<br>25 ‚ÄúTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?
<br>
<br>28 ‚ÄúAnd why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you‚Äîyou of little faith? 31 So do not worry, saying, ‚ÄòWhat shall we eat?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat shall we drink?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat shall we wear?‚Äô 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorro</div>

Seems I didn't have to, since you already knew that. Yet you _still_ believe that, even the actual Israelites (and the tribe of Judah) weren't ever the ones who the Bible was talking about.<br><br>Well, doesn't the Bible condemn the Israelites' (and Judeans') behavior _all throughout both Testaments_ already? Then what's the issue with the Bible talking about them?<br><br>And yes, I know that most of them are lying thieving hypocrites, and yes, as Revelation 2:9 says (and as you said to <a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/92035.html#92099">&gt;&gt;92099</a>), they are indeed the Synagogue of Satan, but only when they don't believe in their heart that Jesus is the Messiah. Unfortunately it's most of them, but think about it. If a Jew weren't born into family corrupted by the Devil, and was brought up Christian, and never betrayed Jesus even when he found out he was "Jewish", would he still be of the Synagogue of Satan? What about the first 5000 Judeans (I know there's a difference between Judeans, Israelites and (((Jews))) already) who converted to Christianity? They were the -*first ones*- oppressed by the Synagogue of Satan, after all.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Romans 2:
<br>God‚Äôs Righteous Judgment
<br>1 You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things. 2 Now we know that God‚Äôs judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. 3 So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God‚Äôs judgment? 4 Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God‚Äôs kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?
<br>
<br>5 But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God‚Äôs wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed. 6 God ‚Äúwill repay each person according to what they have done.‚Äù 7 To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. 8 But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger. 9 There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; 10 but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. 11 For God does not show favoritism.
<br>
<br>12 All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. 13 For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God‚Äôs sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. 14 (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. 15 They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) 16 This will take place on the day when God judges people‚Äôs secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">The Jews and the Law
<br>17 Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God; 18 if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law; 19 if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark, 20 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth‚Äî 21 you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal? 22 You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? 23 You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? 24 As it is written: ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.‚Äù
<br>
<br>25 Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised. 26 So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law‚Äôs requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised? 27 The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.
<br>
<br>28 A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. 29 No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person‚Äôs praise is not from other people, but from God.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Isaiah 3:
<br>Judgment on Jerusalem and Judah
<br>1 See now, the Lord,
<br>    the Lord Almighty,
<br>is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah
<br>    both supply and support:
<br>all supplies of food and all supplies of water,
<br>2     the hero and the warrior,
<br>the judge and the prophet,
<br>    the diviner and the elder,
<br>3 the captain of fifty and the man of rank,
<br>    the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter.
<br>
<br>4 ‚ÄúI will make mere youths their officials;
<br>    children will rule over them.‚Äù
<br>
<br>5 People will oppress each other‚Äî
<br>    man against man, neighbor against neighbor.
<br>The young will rise up against the old,
<br>    the nobody against the honored.
<br>
<br>6 A man will seize one of his brothers
<br>    in his father‚Äôs house, and say,
<br>‚ÄúYou have a cloak, you be our leader;
<br>    take charge of this heap of ruins!‚Äù
<br>7 But in that day he will cry out,
<br>    ‚ÄúI have no remedy.
<br>I have no food or clothing in my house;
<br>    do not make me the leader of the people.‚Äù
<br>
<br>8 Jerusalem staggers,
<br>    Judah is falling;
<br>their words and deeds are against the Lord,
<br>    defying his glorious presence.
<br>9 The look on their faces testifies against them;
<br>    they parade their sin like Sodom;
<br>    they do not hide it.
<br>Woe to them!
<br>    They have brought disaster upon themselves.
<br>
<br>10 Tell the righteous it will be well with them,
<br>    for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.
<br>11 Woe to the wicked!
<br>    Disaster is upon them!
<br>They will be paid back
<br>    for what their hands have done.
<br>
<br>12 Youths oppress my people,
<br>    women rule over them.
<br>My people, your guides lead you astray;
<br>    they turn you from the path.
<br>
<br>13 The Lord takes his place in court;
<br>    he rises to judge the people.
<br>14 The Lord enters into judgment
<br>    against the elders and leaders of his people:
<br>‚ÄúIt is you who have ruined my vineyard;
<br>    the plunder from the poor is in your houses.
<br>15 What do you mean by crushing my people
<br>    and grinding the faces of the poor?‚Äù
<br>declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.
<br>
<br>16 The Lord says,
<br>    ‚ÄúThe women of Zion are haughty,
<br>walking along with outstretched necks,
<br>    flirting with their eyes,
<br>strutting along with swaying hips,
<br>    with ornaments jingling on their ankles.
<br>17 Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion;
<br>    the Lord will make their scalps bald.‚Äù
<br>
<br>18 In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces, 19 the earrings and bracelets and veils, 20 the headdresses and anklets and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms, 21 the signet rings and nose rings, 22 the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses 23 and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.
<br>24 Instead of fragrance there will be a stench;
<br>    instead of a sash, a rope;
<br>instead of well-dressed hair, baldness;
<br>    instead of fine clothing, sackcloth;
<br>    instead of beauty, branding.
<br>25 Your men will fall by the sword,
<br>    your warriors in battle.
<br>26 The gates of Zion will lament and mourn;
<br>    destitute, she will sit on the ground.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Luke 17:
<br>Sin, Faith, Duty
<br>1 Jesus said to his disciples: ‚ÄúThings that cause people to stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come. 2 It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble. 3 So watch yourselves.
<br>
<br>‚ÄúIf your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them. 4 Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying ‚ÄòI repent,‚Äô you must forgive them.‚Äù
<br>
<br>5 The apostles said to the Lord, ‚ÄúIncrease our faith!‚Äù
<br>
<br>6 He replied, ‚ÄúIf you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‚ÄòBe uprooted and planted in the sea,‚Äô and it will obey you.
<br>
<br>7 ‚ÄúSuppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, ‚ÄòCome along now and sit down to eat‚Äô? 8 Won‚Äôt he rather say, ‚ÄòPrepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink‚Äô? 9 Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do? 10 So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, ‚ÄòWe are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.‚Äô‚Äù
<br>
<br>Jesus Heals Ten Men With Leprosy
<br>11 Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. 12 As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance 13 and called out in a loud voice, ‚ÄúJesus, Master, have pity on us!‚Äù
<br>
<br>14 When he saw them, he said, ‚ÄúGo, show yourselves to the priests.‚Äù And as they went, they were cleansed.
<br>
<br>15 One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. 16 He threw himself at Jesus‚Äô feet and thanked him‚Äîand he was a Samaritan.
<br>
<br>17 Jesus asked, ‚ÄúWere not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? 18 Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?‚Äù 19 Then he said to him, ‚ÄúRise and go; your faith has made you well.‚Äù
<br>The Coming of the Kingdom of God
<br>20 Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, ‚ÄúThe coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed, 21 nor will people say, ‚ÄòHere it is,‚Äô or ‚ÄòThere it is,‚Äô because the kingdom of God is in your midst.‚Äù
<br>
<br>22 Then he said to his disciples, ‚ÄúThe time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. 23 People will tell you, ‚ÄòThere he is!‚Äô or ‚ÄòHere he is!‚Äô Do not go running off after them. 24 For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other. 25 But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
<br>
<br>26 ‚ÄúJust as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. 27 People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.
<br>
<br>28 ‚ÄúIt was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. 29 But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
<br>
<br>30 ‚ÄúIt will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed. 31 On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything. 32 Remember Lot‚Äôs wife! 33 Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it. 34 I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. 35 Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.‚Äù [36] 
<br>
<br>37 ‚ÄúWhere, Lord?‚Äù they asked.
<br>
<br>He replied, ‚ÄúWhere there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather.‚Äù</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Romans 3:<br>God‚Äôs Faithfulness<br>1 What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision? 2 Much in every way! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God.<br><br>3 What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God‚Äôs faithfulness? 4 Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written:<br><br>‚ÄúSo that you may be proved right when you speak<br>    and prevail when you judge.‚Äù<br><br>5 But if our unrighteousness brings out God‚Äôs righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.) 6 Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world? 7 Someone might argue, ‚ÄúIf my falsehood enhances God‚Äôs truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?‚Äù 8 Why not say‚Äîas some slanderously claim that we say‚Äî‚ÄúLet us do evil that good may result‚Äù? Their condemnation is just!<br><br>No One Is Righteous<br>9 What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin. 10 As it is written:<br>‚ÄúThere is no one righteous, not even one;<br>11     there is no one who understands;<br>    there is no one who seeks God.<br>12 All have turned away,<br>    they have together become worthless;<br>there is no one who does good,<br>    not even one.‚Äù<br>13 ‚ÄúTheir throats are open graves;<br>    their tongues practice deceit.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThe poison of vipers is on their lips.‚Äù<br>14     ‚ÄúTheir mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.‚Äù<br>15 ‚ÄúTheir feet are swift to shed blood;<br>16     ruin and misery mark their ways,<br>17 and the way of peace they do not know.‚Äù<br>18     ‚ÄúThere is no fear of God before their eyes.‚Äù<br><br>19 Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. 20 Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God‚Äôs sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.<br><br>Righteousness Through Faith<br>21 But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. 22 This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 25 God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood‚Äîto be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished‚Äî 26 he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.<br><br>27 Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. 28 For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. 29 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, 30 since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith. 31 Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Romans 4:<br>Abraham Justified by Faith<br>1 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered in this matter? 2 If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about‚Äîbut not before God. 3 What does Scripture say? ‚ÄúAbraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.‚Äù<br><br>4 Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. 5 However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness. 6 David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:<br><br>7 ‚ÄúBlessed are those<br>    whose transgressions are forgiven,<br>    whose sins are covered.<br>8 Blessed is the one<br>    whose sin the Lord will never count against them.‚Äù<br><br>9 Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham‚Äôs faith was credited to him as righteousness. 10 Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before! 11 And he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them. 12 And he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.<br>13 It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith. 14 For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless, 15 because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.<br><br>16 Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham‚Äôs offspring‚Äînot only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all. 17 As it is written: ‚ÄúI have made you a father of many nations.‚Äù He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed‚Äîthe God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not.<br><br>18 Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, ‚ÄúSo shall your offspring be.‚Äù 19 Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead‚Äîsince he was about a hundred years old‚Äîand that Sarah‚Äôs womb was also dead. 20 Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, 21 being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. 22 This is why ‚Äúit was credited to him as righteousness.‚Äù 23 The words ‚Äúit was credited to him‚Äù were written not for him alone, 24 but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness‚Äîfor us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. 25 He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/92035.html#92525">&gt;&gt;92525</a><br>John 6:<br>Jesus the Bread of Life<br>25 When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, ‚ÄúRabbi, when did you get here?‚Äù<br><br>26 Jesus answered, ‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. 27 Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.‚Äù<br><br>28 Then they asked him, ‚ÄúWhat must we do to do the works God requires?‚Äù<br><br>29 Jesus answered, ‚ÄúThe work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.‚Äù<br><br>30 So they asked him, ‚ÄúWhat sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? 31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‚ÄòHe gave them bread from heaven to eat.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>32 Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.‚Äù<br><br>34 ‚ÄúSir,‚Äù they said, ‚Äúalways give us this bread.‚Äù<br><br>35 Then Jesus declared, ‚ÄúI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. 36 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. 37 All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. 38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. 40 For my Father‚Äôs will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.‚Äù<br><br>41 At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, ‚ÄúI am the bread that came down from heaven.‚Äù 42 They said, ‚ÄúIs this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, ‚ÄòI came down from heaven‚Äô?‚Äù<br>43 ‚ÄúStop grumbling among yourselves,‚Äù Jesus answered. 44 ‚ÄúNo one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day. 45 It is written in the Prophets: ‚ÄòThey will all be taught by God.‚Äô Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me. 46 No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. 47 Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. 50 But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.‚Äù<br><br>52 Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, ‚ÄúHow can this man give us his flesh to eat?‚Äù<br><br>53 Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. 55 For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.‚Äù 59 He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Matthew 18:
<br>The Greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven
<br>1 At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‚ÄúWho, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?‚Äù
<br>
<br>2 He called a little child to him, and placed the child among them. 3 And he said: ‚ÄúTruly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 4 Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 5 And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.
<br>
<br>Causing to Stumble
<br>6 ‚ÄúIf anyone causes one of these little ones‚Äîthose who believe in me‚Äîto stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. 7 Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come! 8 If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. 9 And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.
<br>
<br>The Parable of the Wandering Sheep
<br>10 ‚ÄúSee that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven. [11] 
<br>
<br>12 ‚ÄúWhat do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? 13 And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. 14 In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.
<br>
<br>Dealing With Sin in the Church
<br>15 ‚ÄúIf your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. 16 But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‚Äòevery matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.‚Äô 17 If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
<br>
<br>18 ‚ÄúTruly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
<br>
<br>19 ‚ÄúAgain, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. 20 For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.‚Äù
<br>
<br>The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant
<br>21 Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, ‚ÄúLord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?‚Äù
<br>
<br>22 Jesus answered, ‚ÄúI tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.
<br>
<br>23 ‚ÄúTherefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. 24 As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him. 25 Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
<br>
<br>26 ‚ÄúAt this the servant fell on his knees before him. ‚ÄòBe patient with me,‚Äô he begged, ‚Äòand I will pay back everything.‚Äô 27 The servant‚Äôs master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.
<br>
<br>28 ‚ÄúBut when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. ‚ÄòPay back what you owe me!‚Äô he demanded.
<br>
<br>29 ‚ÄúHis fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, ‚ÄòBe patient with me, and I will pay it back.‚Äô
<br>
<br>30 ‚ÄúBut he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. 31 When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened.
<br>
<br>32 ‚ÄúThen the master called the servant in. ‚ÄòYou wicked serva</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Matthew 12:
<br>Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath
<br>1 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. 2 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, ‚ÄúLook! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.‚Äù
<br>
<br>3 He answered, ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? 4 He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread‚Äîwhich was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. 5 Or haven‚Äôt you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent? 6 I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. 7 If you had known what these words mean, ‚ÄòI desire mercy, not sacrifice,‚Äô you would not have condemned the innocent. 8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.‚Äù
<br>
<br>9 Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, 10 and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, ‚ÄúIs it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?‚Äù
<br>
<br>11 He said to them, ‚ÄúIf any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? 12 How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.‚Äù
<br>
<br>13 Then he said to the man, ‚ÄúStretch out your hand.‚Äù So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. 14 But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
<br>
<br>God‚Äôs Chosen Servant
<br>15 Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill. 16 He warned them not to tell others about him. 17 This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
<br>
<br>18 ‚ÄúHere is my servant whom I have chosen,
<br>    the one I love, in whom I delight;
<br>I will put my Spirit on him,
<br>    and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
<br>19 He will not quarrel or cry out;
<br>    no one will hear his voice in the streets.
<br>20 A bruised reed he will not break,
<br>    and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out,
<br>till he has brought justice through to victory.
<br>21     In his name the nations will put their hope.‚Äù
<br>Jesus and Beelzebul
<br>22 Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. 23 All the people were astonished and said, ‚ÄúCould this be the Son of David?‚Äù
<br>
<br>24 But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, ‚ÄúIt is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.‚Äù
<br>
<br>25 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, ‚ÄúEvery kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. 26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? 27 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. 28 But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
<br>
<br>29 ‚ÄúOr again, how can anyone enter a strong man‚Äôs house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.
<br>
<br>30 ‚ÄúWhoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. 31 And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32 Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
<br>
<br>33 ‚ÄúMake a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. 34 You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. 35 A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. 36 But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Colossians 3:<br>Living as Those Made Alive in Christ<br>1 Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 2 Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. 3 For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. 4 When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.<br><br>5 Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. 6 Because of these, the wrath of God is coming. 7 You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. 8 But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. 9 Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices 10 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. 11 Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.<br><br>12 Therefore, as God‚Äôs chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. 13 Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. 14 And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.<br><br>15 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. 16 Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. 17 And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.<br><br>Instructions for Christian Households<br>18 Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.<br><br>19 Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.<br><br>20 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.<br><br>21 Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged.<br><br>22 Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. 23 Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, 24 since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. 25 Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs, and there is no favoritism.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">John 8:
<br>1 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
<br>
<br>2 At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. 3 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group 4 and said to Jesus, ‚ÄúTeacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?‚Äù 6 They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.
<br>
<br>But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ‚ÄúLet any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.‚Äù 8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
<br>
<br>9 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 10 Jesus straightened up and asked her, ‚ÄúWoman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?‚Äù
<br>
<br>11 ‚ÄúNo one, sir,‚Äù she said.
<br>
<br>‚ÄúThen neither do I condemn you,‚Äù Jesus declared. ‚ÄúGo now and leave your life of sin.‚Äù</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Dispute Over Jesus‚Äô Testimony
<br>12 When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, ‚ÄúI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.‚Äù
<br>
<br>13 The Pharisees challenged him, ‚ÄúHere you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.‚Äù
<br>
<br>14 Jesus answered, ‚ÄúEven if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going. 15 You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one. 16 But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me. 17 In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true. 18 I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.‚Äù
<br>
<br>19 Then they asked him, ‚ÄúWhere is your father?‚Äù
<br>
<br>‚ÄúYou do not know me or my Father,‚Äù Jesus replied. ‚ÄúIf you knew me, you would know my Father also.‚Äù 20 He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come.
<br>
<br>Dispute Over Who Jesus Is
<br>21 Once more Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúI am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.‚Äù
<br>
<br>22 This made the Jews ask, ‚ÄúWill he kill himself? Is that why he says, ‚ÄòWhere I go, you cannot come‚Äô?‚Äù
<br>
<br>23 But he continued, ‚ÄúYou are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. 24 I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, you will indeed die in your sins.‚Äù
<br>
<br>25 ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù they asked.
<br>
<br>‚ÄúJust what I have been telling you from the beginning,‚Äù Jesus replied. 26 ‚ÄúI have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.‚Äù
<br>
<br>27 They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. 28 So Jesus said, ‚ÄúWhen you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me. 29 The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.‚Äù 30 Even as he spoke, many believed in him.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Dispute Over Whose Children Jesus‚Äô Opponents Are
<br>31 To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, ‚ÄúIf you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. 32 Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù
<br>
<br>33 They answered him, ‚ÄúWe are Abraham‚Äôs descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?‚Äù
<br>
<br>34 Jesus replied, ‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. 35 Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. 36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. 37 I know that you are Abraham‚Äôs descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because you have no room for my word. 38 I am telling you what I have seen in the Father‚Äôs presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father.‚Äù
<br>
<br>39 ‚ÄúAbraham is our father,‚Äù they answered.
<br>
<br>‚ÄúIf you were Abraham‚Äôs children,‚Äù said Jesus, ‚Äúthen you would do what Abraham did. 40 As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things. 41 You are doing the works of your own father.‚Äù
<br>
<br>‚ÄúWe are not illegitimate children,‚Äù they protested. ‚ÄúThe only Father we have is God himself.‚Äù
<br>
<br>42 Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúIf God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. 43 Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. 44 You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father‚Äôs desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. 45 Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me! 46 Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don‚Äôt you believe me? 47 Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.‚Äù
<br>
<br>Jesus‚Äô Claims About Himself
<br>48 The Jews answered him, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?‚Äù
<br>49 ‚ÄúI am not possessed by a demon,‚Äù said Jesus, ‚Äúbut I honor my Father and you dishonor me. 50 I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge. 51 Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.‚Äù
<br>
<br>52 At this they exclaimed, ‚ÄúNow we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. 53 Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?‚Äù
<br>
<br>54 Jesus replied, ‚ÄúIf I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me. 55 Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word. 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.‚Äù
<br>
<br>57 ‚ÄúYou are not yet fifty years old,‚Äù they said to him, ‚Äúand you have seen Abraham!‚Äù
<br>
<br>58 ‚ÄúVery truly I tell you,‚Äù Jesus answered, ‚Äúbefore Abraham was born, I am!‚Äù 59 At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Ephesians 2:<br>Made Alive in Christ<br>1 As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, 2 in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. 3 All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. 4 But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, 5 made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions‚Äîit is by grace you have been saved. 6 And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 7 in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. 8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith‚Äîand this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God‚Äî 9 not by works, so that no one can boast. 10 For we are God‚Äôs handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.<br><br>Jew and Gentile Reconciled Through Christ<br>11 Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called ‚Äúuncircumcised‚Äù by those who call themselves ‚Äúthe circumcision‚Äù (which is done in the body by human hands)‚Äî 12 remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.<br><br>14 For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, 15 by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace, 16 and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility. 17 He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. 18 For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.<br><br>19 Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God‚Äôs people and also members of his household, 20 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. 21 In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. 22 And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Mark 15:<br>The Crucifixion of Jesus<br>21 A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. 22 They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means ‚Äúthe place of the skull‚Äù). 23 Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. 24 And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.<br><br>25 It was nine in the morning when they crucified him. 26 The written notice of the charge against him read: the king of the jews.<br><br>27 They crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left. [28]  29 Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, ‚ÄúSo! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, 30 come down from the cross and save yourself!‚Äù 31 In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. ‚ÄúHe saved others,‚Äù they said, ‚Äúbut he can‚Äôt save himself! 32 Let this Messiah, this king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.‚Äù Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.<br><br>The Death of Jesus<br>33 At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. 34 And at three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, ‚ÄúEloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?‚Äù (which means ‚ÄúMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?‚Äù).<br><br>35 When some of those standing near heard this, they said, ‚ÄúListen, he‚Äôs calling Elijah.‚Äù<br><br>36 Someone ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. ‚ÄúNow leave him alone. Let‚Äôs see if Elijah comes to take him down,‚Äù he said.<br><br>37 With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.<br><br>38 The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 39 And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, saw how he died, he said, ‚ÄúSurely this man was the Son of God!‚Äù<br><br>40 Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joseph, and Salome. 41 In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">2 Peter 3:<br>The Day of the Lord<br>1 Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking. 2 I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.<br><br>3 Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. 4 They will say, ‚ÄúWhere is this ‚Äòcoming‚Äô he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.‚Äù 5 But they deliberately forget that long ago by God‚Äôs word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water. 6 By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. 7 By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.<br><br>8 But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. 9 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.<br><br>10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.<br><br>11 Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives 12 as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat. 13 But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.<br><br>14 So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him. 15 Bear in mind that our Lord‚Äôs patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. 16 He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.<br><br>17 Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position. 18 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Romans 13:
<br>
<br>Submission to Governing Authorities
<br>1 Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 4 For the one in authority is God‚Äôs servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God‚Äôs servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.
<br>
<br>6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God‚Äôs servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.
<br>
<br>Love Fulfills the Law
<br>8 Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law. 9 The commandments, ‚ÄúYou shall not commit adultery,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou shall not murder,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou shall not steal,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou shall not covet,‚Äù and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one command: ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself.‚Äù 10 Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
<br>
<br>The Day Is Near
<br>11 And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. 12 The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. 13 Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. 14 Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">1 Corinthians 13:<br><br>1&nbsp;If I speak in the tongues&nbsp;of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.&nbsp;2&nbsp;If I have the gift of prophecy&nbsp;and can fathom all mysteries&nbsp;and all knowledge,&nbsp;and if I have a faith&nbsp;that can move mountains,&nbsp;but do not have love, I am nothing.&nbsp;3&nbsp;If I give all I possess to the poor&nbsp;and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,&nbsp;but do not have love, I gain nothing.<br><br>4&nbsp;Love is patient,&nbsp;love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.&nbsp;5&nbsp;It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking,&nbsp;it is not easily angered,&nbsp;it keeps no record of wrongs.&nbsp;6&nbsp;Love does not delight in evil&nbsp;but rejoices with the truth.&nbsp;7&nbsp;It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.<br><br>8&nbsp;Love never fails. But where there are prophecies,&nbsp;they will cease; where there are tongues,&nbsp;they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.&nbsp;9&nbsp;For we know in part&nbsp;and we prophesy in part,&nbsp;10&nbsp;but when completeness comes,&nbsp;what is in part disappears.&nbsp;11&nbsp;When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood&nbsp;behind me.&nbsp;12&nbsp;For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror;&nbsp;then we shall see face to face.&nbsp;Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.<br><br>13&nbsp;And now these three remain: faith, hope and love.&nbsp;But the greatest of these is love.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Unity and Diversity in the Body<br>12 Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. 13 For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body‚Äîwhether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free‚Äîand we were all given the one Spirit to drink. 14 Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many.<br><br>15 Now if the foot should say, ‚ÄúBecause I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,‚Äù it would not for that reason stop being part of the body. 16 And if the ear should say, ‚ÄúBecause I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,‚Äù it would not for that reason stop being part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But in fact God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. 19 If they were all one part, where would the body be? 20 As it is, there are many parts, but one body.<br><br>21 The eye cannot say to the hand, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you!‚Äù And the head cannot say to the feet, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you!‚Äù 22 On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 23 and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, 24 while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it, 25 so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. 26 If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.<br><br>27 Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. 28 And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues. 29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30 Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? 31 Now eagerly desire the greater gifts.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">1 John 4:<br>Test the Spirits<br>1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. 4 Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. 5 They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.<br><br>God Is Love<br>7 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. 10 In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.<br><br>13 By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 16 So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 17 By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love. 19 We love because he first loved us. 20 If anyone says, ‚ÄúI love God,‚Äù and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. 21 And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">1 Corinthians 3:<br>The Church and Its Leaders<br>1 Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly‚Äîmere infants in Christ. 2 I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. 3 You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans? 4 For when one says, ‚ÄúI follow Paul,‚Äù and another, ‚ÄúI follow Apollos,‚Äù are you not mere human beings?<br><br>5 What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe‚Äîas the Lord has assigned to each his task. 6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. 7 So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. 8 The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor. 9 For we are co-workers in God‚Äôs service; you are God‚Äôs field, God‚Äôs building.<br><br>10 By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. 11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12 If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, 13 their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person‚Äôs work. 14 If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward. 15 If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved‚Äîeven though only as one escaping through the flames.<br><br>16 Don‚Äôt you know that you yourselves are God‚Äôs temple and that God‚Äôs Spirit dwells in your midst? 17 If anyone destroys God‚Äôs temple, God will destroy that person; for God‚Äôs temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.<br><br>18 Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become ‚Äúfools‚Äù so that you may become wise. 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God‚Äôs sight. As it is written: ‚ÄúHe catches the wise in their craftiness‚Äù; 20 and again, ‚ÄúThe Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.‚Äù 21 So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours, 22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future‚Äîall are yours, 23 and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Romans 10:<br>1 Brothers and sisters, my heart‚Äôs desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. 2 For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. 3 Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God‚Äôs righteousness. 4 Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.<br><br>5 Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: ‚ÄúThe person who does these things will live by them.‚Äù 6 But the righteousness that is by faith says: ‚ÄúDo not say in your heart, ‚ÄòWho will ascend into heaven?‚Äô‚Äù (that is, to bring Christ down) 7 ‚Äúor ‚ÄòWho will descend into the deep?‚Äô‚Äù (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). 8 But what does it say? ‚ÄúThe word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,‚Äù that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: 9 If you declare with your mouth, ‚ÄúJesus is Lord,‚Äù and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. 11 As Scripture says, ‚ÄúAnyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.‚Äù 12 For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile‚Äîthe same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, 13 for, ‚ÄúEveryone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.‚Äù<br><br>14 How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? 15 And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: ‚ÄúHow beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!‚Äù<br><br>16 But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, ‚ÄúLord, who has believed our message?‚Äù 17 Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ. 18 But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did:<br><br>‚ÄúTheir voice has gone out into all the earth,<br>    their words to the ends of the world.‚Äù<br><br>19 Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says,<br><br>‚ÄúI will make you envious by those who are not a nation;<br>    I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.‚Äù<br><br>20 And Isaiah boldly says,<br><br>‚ÄúI was found by those who did not seek me;<br>    I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.‚Äù<br><br>21 But concerning Israel he says,<br><br>‚ÄúAll day long I have held out my hands<br>    to a disobedient and obstinate people.‚Äù</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Matthew 10:<br>Jesus Sends Out the Twelve<br>1 Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.<br><br>2 These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; 3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 4 Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.<br><br>5 These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: ‚ÄúDo not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. 6 Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. 7 As you go, proclaim this message: ‚ÄòThe kingdom of heaven has come near.‚Äô 8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.<br><br>9 ‚ÄúDo not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts‚Äî 10 no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep. 11 Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave. 12 As you enter the home, give it your greeting. 13 If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. 14 If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. 15 Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.<br><br>16 ‚ÄúI am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. 17 Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues. 18 On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. 19 But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, 20 for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.<br><br>21 ‚ÄúBrother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. 22 You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 23 When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.<br><br>24 ‚ÄúThe student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master. 25 It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!</div>

  <div class="divMessage">1 John 3:<br>More on Love and Hatred<br>11 For this is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one another. 12 Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother‚Äôs were righteous. 13 Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death. 15 Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.<br><br>16 This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. 17 If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? 18 Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.</div>

Zeus and his olympians. Christianity as an incomplete source of where God came from is answered with Asatru. What the godlike beings got up to is answered with Hellenism.<br><br>Religions only make sense if you link "perceived as different gods" stories together and ignore jewish fables as instructed in Titus 1:14.<br>You don't have to worship the Aesir nor Olympians.<br><br>Once again before some fool states otherwise, Christianity is not jewish. It is stolen by jews and claimed as theirs. That is the difference. The only way they ever operate. A bunch of kikes said the oldest existing tomes in Greek were translated from older Hebrew texts that do not exist and a bunch of gullible dipshits believed them.</div>

Read 1 John 3 instead of coming to the worst conclusions, This thread was made with the purpose of sharing enriching Bible Verses, there is Absolutely no reason to your mindless scorning and defacing of Jews, Jesus Christ, The New and Old Testament all already admit how Wicked all men are, First the Jew, then the Gentile. Do me the favour of trying to love instead of hating. The greatest and worst people on earth are both Jews, I get it.

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/92035.html#93814">&gt;&gt;93814</a><br>You don't get to dictate rules here. Our hatred of jews is far from mindless. We are the most thoughtful most well-researched ideology on Earth about what our enemy has gotten up to. The rest of you lemmings wandering around drooling all over yourselves moaning "not the jews" only wallow in your own ignorance.<br><br>You really thought you could come here and post endless bible verses to change our minds and stop hating the parasites that ruin everyone's lives? Stop the hate? No. I don't think so. The very bible you so adore, you ignore verses from <a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/92035.html#92082">&gt;&gt;92082</a> because you're a hypocrite. You won't read this history of their vile deeds because you would rather shut it out. Yet you hate as well. Your eyes burn at the suggestion of "pagans" and all those who fall under your brainwashed mental definition of "bigot".<br><br>The definition of bigot was different before (((Jacqui Safra))) bought out Encyclopedia Britannica to change the meanings of words. 12th century France is the origin. It means sanctimonious, religious hypocrite.<br><br>In other words: You. Blind to the Synagogue of Satan as so many of your flock. Fools who think jews are "great". Hypocrites who spout such filth as you accuse of filth.<br>You hate hypocritically, wanting our hate to stop while hating other religions as "pagans". Not even practicing what you preach.<br>We hate truthfully, respecting all religions but Judaism and Satanism, for those and their people are evil. You would know this if you weren't a stubborn hypocrite.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Matthew 24:<br>The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times<br>1 Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. 2 ‚ÄúDo you see all these things?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúTruly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.‚Äù<br><br>3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. ‚ÄúTell us,‚Äù they said, ‚Äúwhen will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?‚Äù<br><br>4 Jesus answered: ‚ÄúWatch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‚ÄòI am the Messiah,‚Äô and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of birth pains.<br><br>9 ‚ÄúThen you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.<br><br>15 ‚ÄúSo when you see standing in the holy place ‚Äòthe abomination that causes desolation,‚Äô spoken of through the prophet Daniel‚Äîlet the reader understand‚Äî 16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17 Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. 18 Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. 19 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! 20 Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now‚Äîand never to be equaled again.<br><br>22 ‚ÄúIf those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. 23 At that time if anyone says to you, ‚ÄòLook, here is the Messiah!‚Äô or, ‚ÄòThere he is!‚Äô do not believe it. 24 For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you ahead of time.<br><br>26 ‚ÄúSo if anyone tells you, ‚ÄòThere he is, out in the wilderness,‚Äô do not go out; or, ‚ÄòHere he is, in the inner rooms,‚Äô do not believe it. 27 For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28 Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.<br><br>29 ‚ÄúImmediately after the distress of those days<br><br>‚Äú‚Äòthe sun will be darkened,<br>    and the moon will not give its light;<br>the stars will fall from the sky,<br>    and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.‚Äô<br><br>30 ‚ÄúThen will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. 31 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.<br><br>32 ‚ÄúNow learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. 33 Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. 34 Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">The Day and Hour Unknown<br>36 ‚ÄúBut about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 37 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; 39 and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 40 Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. 41 Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.<br><br>42 ‚ÄúTherefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. 43 But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. 44 So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.<br><br>45 ‚ÄúWho then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? 46 It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. 47 Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. 48 But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, ‚ÄòMy master is staying away a long time,‚Äô 49 and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. 50 The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. 51 He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Mark 12:<br>Paying the Imperial Tax to Caesar<br>13 Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words. 14 They came to him and said, ‚ÄúTeacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You aren‚Äôt swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay the imperial tax to Caesar or not? 15 Should we pay or shouldn‚Äôt we?‚Äù<br><br>But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. ‚ÄúWhy are you trying to trap me?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúBring me a denarius and let me look at it.‚Äù 16 They brought the coin, and he asked them, ‚ÄúWhose image is this?

  <div class="divMessage">1 Thessalonians 5:<br>The Day of the Lord<br>1 Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, 2 for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 3 While people are saying, ‚ÄúPeace and safety,‚Äù destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.<br><br>4 But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. 5 You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. 6 So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. 7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. 8 But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. 9 For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 10 He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him. 11 Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.<br><br>Final Instructions<br>12 Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you. 13 Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. 14 And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone. 15 Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.<br><br>16 Rejoice always, 17 pray continually, 18 give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God‚Äôs will for you in Christ Jesus.<br><br>19 Do not quench the Spirit. 20 Do not treat prophecies with contempt 21 but test them all; hold on to what is good, 22 reject every kind of evil.<br><br>23 May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 24 The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.<br><br>25 Brothers and sisters, pray for us. 26 Greet all God‚Äôs people with a holy kiss. 27 I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.<br><br>28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Matthew 15:<br>That Which Defiles<br>1 Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, 2 ‚ÄúWhy do your disciples break the tradition of the elders?

Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. 7 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:<br><br>8 ‚Äú‚ÄòThese people honor me with their lips,<br>    but their hearts are far from me.<br>9 They worship me in vain;<br>    their teachings are merely human rules.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>10 Jesus called the crowd to him and said, ‚ÄúListen and understand. 11 What goes into someone‚Äôs mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.‚Äù<br><br>12 Then the disciples came to him and asked, ‚ÄúDo you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?‚Äù<br><br>13 He replied, ‚ÄúEvery plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. 14 Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.‚Äù<br><br>15 Peter said, ‚ÄúExplain the parable to us.‚Äù<br><br>16 ‚ÄúAre you still so dull?‚Äù Jesus asked them. 17 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? 18 But the things that come out of a person‚Äôs mouth come from the heart, and these defile them. 19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts‚Äîmurder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. 20 These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.‚Äù</div>

  <div class="divMessage">1 Corinthians 6:<br>Lawsuits Against Believers<br>1 When one of you has a grievance against another, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints? 2 Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases? 3 Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters pertaining to this life! 4 So if you have such cases, why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church? 5 I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers, 6 but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers? 7 To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded? 8 But you yourselves wrong and defraud‚Äîeven your own brothers!<br><br>9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, 10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Glorify God in Body and Spirit<br>12 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. 13 Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 14 And God both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His power.<br><br>15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot? Certainly not! 16 Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body with her? For ‚Äúthe two,‚Äù He says, ‚Äúshall become one flesh.‚Äù 17 But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.<br><br>18 Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. 19 Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? 20 For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God‚Äôs.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Deuteronomy 15:<br>The Year for Canceling Debts<br>1 At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts. 2 This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made to a fellow Israelite. They shall not require payment from anyone among their own people, because the Lord‚Äôs time for canceling debts has been proclaimed. 3 You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you. 4 However, there need be no poor people among you, for in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless you, 5 if only you fully obey the Lord your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today. 6 For the Lord your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you.<br><br>7 If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward them. 8 Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need. 9 Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: ‚ÄúThe seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near,‚Äù so that you do not show ill will toward the needy among your fellow Israelites and give them nothing. They may then appeal to the Lord against you, and you will be found guilty of sin. 10 Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to. 11 There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land.<br><br>Freeing Servants<br>12 If any of your people‚ÄîHebrew men or women‚Äîsell themselves to you and serve you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free. 13 And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed. 14 Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to them as the Lord your God has blessed you. 15 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this command today.<br><br>16 But if your servant says to you, ‚ÄúI do not want to leave you,‚Äù because he loves you and your family and is well off with you, 17 then take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door, and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your female servant.<br><br>18 Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Romans 8:<br>Present Suffering and Future Glory<br>18 I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. 19 For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. 20 For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope 21 that[h] the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.<br><br>22 We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. 23 Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies. 24 For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have? 25 But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.<br><br>26 In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. 27 And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God‚Äôs people in accordance with the will of God.<br><br>28 And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who[i] have been called according to his purpose. 29 For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. 30 And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">More Than Conquerors<br>31 What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all‚Äîhow will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? 33 Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. 34 Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died‚Äîmore than that, who was raised to life‚Äîis at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? 36 As it is written:<br><br>‚ÄúFor your sake we face death all day long;<br>    we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.‚Äù[j]<br><br>37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[k] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">OP face reveal, just wanted to recollect my thoughts somewhat, somewhere. It's weird to see the old covers of my mp3 files, Most are blank now or otherwise have an image of a Plushie on them now, In the past I just wanted to have a pretty picture on them and thought the artsy aesthetic japanese photographers on Instagram did the job but it would be awkward to meet a girl and have her see thousands of different women displayed on my music playlist so, no more of asian women photography.<br><br>Anyways, I never had a Girlfriend and I wished for a Soulmate for what is now the majority of my lifetime. What ended up happening a few months ago is that I fell in love with someone who played pretend and left me feeling betrayed and cheated. The Person came into my life herself so I was hopeful and overjoyed that it meant that is was from God but she is forgiven anyhow.<br><br>It would be easy to remain enraged daily and point out to God His own Scripture:<br>"Luke 11:10 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 11 If a son asks for [e]bread from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish?"<br><br>I don't want to equate a human being to bread or fish of course and I certainly do not want to tell God that He is an inadequate Father. To my limited understanding, God is probably telling me that He betrayed my Wish in the same way I betray Him by the Sins I do not flee.<br><br>Even in my heart of hearts, it seems obvious that I idolize a desire for A Second-Half over God. I should not Worship anyone but God.<br><br>I tried my hardest the last few months to wash my Hands of all that reeks of sin off me and I'm fully aware only Jesus Christ's Blood Absolves my Crimes, Not my Actions, I just dont want to sin any more and try to do what I must in the Name of The Lord.<br><br>When it comes to my Greatest Desire, I will try my best to read and fathom more of the scripture to remain upright and not disheartened. It is a bit difficult to live feeling guilty and confused, Some days I cry over how Spiritually Lonely I feel, other times my Heart Palpitates out of Dread and I remain in the dark, Silent.<br><br>"Be Joyful in Hope, Patient in Affliction, Hopeful in Prayer"<br>I will continue to Hope for a Loved one while trying hard not to make it an Idolization, God First. It is however, always important to keep in mind that everything is God's Will, He might never want me to be Betrothed and I must be at Peace with Either Outcomes, There is so much He Blessed and Blesses me with from my Wealth to my Health to the Peace in my Heart.<br><br>May you be Blessed with Health and Peace too, Jesus Christ be with you.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">1 Corinthians 2:<br>God‚Äôs Wisdom Revealed by the Spirit<br>6 We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. 7 No, we declare God‚Äôs wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. 8 None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 9 However, as it is written:<br><br>‚ÄúWhat no eye has seen,<br>    what no ear has heard,<br>and what no human mind has conceived‚Äù[b]‚Äî<br>    the things God has prepared for those who love him‚Äî<br><br>10 these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.<br><br>The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 11 For who knows a person‚Äôs thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 12 What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. 13 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words.[c] 14 The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. 15 The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, 16 for,<br><br>‚ÄúWho has known the mind of the Lord<br>    so as to instruct him?‚Äù[d]<br><br>But we have the mind of Christ.</div>

<br>To my knowledge, My ancestry only includes Siberian, Romanian/Moldovan and Russian Blood but I blatantly lie on Job Applications and mention that I'm a jew to have a better chance of getting hired by their cringe Canadian DEI regulations.
<br>
<br>The only ideal is Jesus Christ, everything else is a crude mockery and/or deception. Only God loves you, Humans seek self interest. National Socialism and Christianity share many things in common but God always comes first and last. I don't like the way you idolize a human being, If you truly have the best interests of your Family and Lineage in mind then God is the answer, The one who knew you before your Birth and the one who Overlooks over you everywhere and always even beyond this temporary life in your best interest. Hopefully you understand this one day, There is Healing, Peace and Health in Christ whereas earthly worries and hatred only cause ill and running in circles.</div>

<br>Lying on applications <em>isn't very Christianlike</em>. I don't see you scorning Lutherans, Protestants, Catholics or Presbyterians with the same accusations towards National Socialism, which was no crude mockery or deception but yet another openly Christian organization. I say <em>was</em> because certain orgs that unironically call themselves "Nazi" such as Atomwaffen and the Azov Battalion have become crude mockeries and either allow jews to infiltrate or blatantly idolize them. As for idolizing Hitler, the literal reference of "idol" doesn't work here. We don't bend our knees and pray to statues of Hitler like jews did when they burned their children to Moloch. Appreciating a man for being great is not worship. By the way, <strong>666 is a geometrical shape</strong>. I'm sure as a Christian yourself, you're aware of what Saturn represents.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">John 1:
<br>The Eternal Word
<br>1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not [a]comprehend it.
<br>
<br>John‚Äôs Witness: The True Light
<br>6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe. 8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. 9 That[b] was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world.
<br>
<br>10 He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. 11 He came to His [c]own, and His [d]own did not receive Him. 12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the [e]right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
<br>
<br>The Word Becomes Flesh
<br>14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
<br>
<br>15 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, ‚ÄúThis was He of whom I said, ‚ÄòHe who comes after me [f]is preferred before me, for He was before me.‚Äô ‚Äù
<br>
<br>16 [g]And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten [h]Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Isaiah 1:
<br>The Wickedness of Judah
<br>2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth!
<br>For the Lord has spoken:
<br>‚ÄúI have nourished and brought up children,
<br>And they have rebelled against Me;
<br>3 The ox knows its owner
<br>And the donkey its master‚Äôs crib;
<br>But Israel does not know,
<br>My people do not consider.‚Äù
<br>
<br>4 Alas, sinful nation,
<br>A people laden with iniquity,
<br>A brood of evildoers,
<br>Children who are corrupters!
<br>They have forsaken the Lord,
<br>They have provoked to anger
<br>The Holy One of Israel,
<br>They have turned away backward.
<br>
<br>5 Why should you be stricken again?
<br>You will revolt more and more.
<br>The whole head is sick,
<br>And the whole heart faints.
<br>6 From the sole of the foot even to the head,
<br>There is no soundness in it,
<br>But wounds and bruises and putrefying sores;
<br>They have not been closed or bound up,
<br>Or soothed with ointment.
<br>
<br>7 Your country is desolate,
<br>Your cities are burned with fire;
<br>Strangers devour your land in your presence;
<br>And it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
<br>8 So the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard,
<br>As a hut in a garden of cucumbers,
<br>As a besieged city.
<br>9 Unless the Lord of hosts
<br>Had left to us a very small remnant,
<br>We would have become like Sodom,
<br>We would have been made like Gomorrah.
<br>
<br>10 Hear the word of the Lord,
<br>You rulers of Sodom;
<br>Give ear to the law of our God,
<br>You people of Gomorrah:
<br>11 ‚ÄúTo what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me?‚Äù
<br>Says the Lord.
<br>‚ÄúI have had enough of burnt offerings of rams
<br>And the fat of fed cattle.
<br>I do not delight in the blood of bulls,
<br>Or of lambs or goats.
<br>
<br>12 ‚ÄúWhen you come to appear before Me,
<br>Who has required this from your hand,
<br>To trample My courts?
<br>13 Bring no more futile sacrifices;
<br>Incense is an abomination to Me.
<br>The New Moons, the Sabbaths, and the calling of assemblies‚Äî
<br>I cannot endure iniquity and the sacred meeting.
<br>14 Your New Moons and your appointed feasts
<br>My soul hates;
<br>They are a trouble to Me,
<br>I am weary of bearing them.
<br>15 When you spread out your hands,
<br>I will hide My eyes from you;
<br>Even though you make many prayers,
<br>I will not hear.
<br>Your hands are full of blood.
<br>
<br>16 ‚ÄúWash yourselves, make yourselves clean;
<br>Put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes.
<br>Cease to do evil,
<br>17 Learn to do good;
<br>Seek justice,
<br>Rebuke the oppressor;
<br>Defend the fatherless,
<br>Plead for the widow.
<br>
<br>18 ‚ÄúCome now, and let us reason together,‚Äù
<br>Says the Lord,
<br>‚ÄúThough your sins are like scarlet,
<br>They shall be as white as snow;
<br>Though they are red like crimson,
<br>They shall be as wool.
<br>19 If you are willing and obedient,
<br>You shall eat the good of the land;
<br>20 But if you refuse and rebel,
<br>You shall be devoured by the sword‚Äù;
<br>For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.</div>

<br>2 Yet they seek Me daily,

<br>7 Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,
<br>And that you bring to your house the poor who are cast out;
<br>When you see the naked, that you cover him,
<br>And not hide yourself from your own flesh?
<br>8 Then your light shall break forth like the morning,
<br>Your healing shall spring forth speedily,
<br>And your righteousness shall go before you;
<br>The glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard.
<br>9 Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer;
<br>You shall cry, and He will say, ‚ÄòHere I am.‚Äô
<br>
<br>‚ÄúIf you take away the yoke from your midst,
<br>The pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,
<br>10 If you extend your soul to the hungry
<br>And satisfy the afflicted soul,
<br>Then your light shall dawn in the darkness,
<br>And your darkness shall be as the noonday.
<br>11 The Lord will guide you continually,
<br>And satisfy your soul in drought,
<br>And strengthen your bones;
<br>You shall be like a watered garden,
<br>And like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.
<br>12 Those from among you
<br>Shall build the old waste places;
<br>You shall raise up the foundations of many generations;
<br>And you shall be called the Repairer of the Breach,
<br>The Restorer of Streets to Dwell In.
<br>
<br>13 ‚ÄúIf you turn away your foot from the Sabbath,
<br>From doing your pleasure on My holy day,
<br>And call the Sabbath a delight,
<br>The holy day of the Lord honorable,
<br>And shall honor Him, not doing your own ways,
<br>Nor finding your own pleasure,
<br>Nor speaking your own words,
<br>14 Then you shall delight yourself in the Lord;
<br>And I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth,
<br>And feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father.
<br>The mouth of the Lord has spoken.‚Äù</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Philippians 2:
<br>Unity Through Humility
<br>1 Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy, 2 fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. 3 Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. 4 Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.
<br>
<br>The Humbled and Exalted Christ
<br>5 Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, 6 who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, 7 but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. 9 Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</div>
