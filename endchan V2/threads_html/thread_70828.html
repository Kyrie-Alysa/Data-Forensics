<br>""Go to the gym, or start a body weight routine fat ass. Don‚Äôt neglect cardio, go for a morning run. Take a cold shower. Get 7-9 hours of good quality sleep every night, avoid stimulants in the late afternoon. Become a morning person and get up early.""

<br>""Hygiene is important. BRUSH YOUR TEETH TWICE A DAY FOR 2 MINUTES, don‚Äôt forget to floss. Make your own toothpaste. Get a tongue scraper too. Your tongue should be a nice pink color, not white or yellow. This is not some ancient, long forgotten secret, but its amazing how many people neglect oral health - it‚Äôs just as important as lifting. Deodorants containing aluminium salts are toxic, avoid their use at all costs. You can make your own spray from baking soda, water and a few drops of a nice smelling essential oil. This will stop body odour without making you sterile.""
<br>
<br>""Lower your carb intake and eat more animal fat. Eat lots of organic meat and fish. The (((food pyramid))) overestimates the amount of carbs you should be eating - stop consuming excessive amounts. Do not eat feminized products soyboy. Treat yourself to an occasional glass of good red wine. Try intermittent fasting, a simple 18/6 routine can work wonders.""
<br>
<br>""Do not breed with roasties or THOT‚Äôs. Find a wholesome waifu. Do not expect to meet a wholesome girl in a bar, nightclub or university campus. Plan a family. Raise strong men and respectable women who will lead in the race war.""
<br>
<br>""Meditate. It calms the mind, builds discipline and is an ancient, tried and tested method of building mental clarity, control and spirituality. Start today, it only takes 10 minutes.""

<br>""Stop consuming (((pornography))). Oh, you think that you‚Äôre not addicted to porn? Prove it. Try to go without porn or fapping for a whole week. Then aim for a month. Its harder than you think.""

  <div class="divMessage">OP here, decided to try expand with some concepts and ideas to help any good NatSoc or Fascist on the long path to becoming an overman. There were always a good few questions regarding mindset and how to steel yourself for the coming tide so i'll post something regarding that.
<br>
<br>The first thing for any man seeking to improve is to understand the disctinction between motivation and dedication as hinted in the original image. It is the very core of your development. The best analogy I came up with is to imagine a forest and within the said forest imagine a great tree. This regal creation full of verdant leaves and ever expanding branches of noble oak expands and grows forever onwards and can weather come what may. The only way to destroy the oak, much like a man whose heart is filled with fire and dedication, is to fell it completely, to tear it assunder. Much like man, it can weather storms, bear deep scars and face almost anything thrown at it. Only the most cataclysmic event can fell the tree or the spirit of a steeled man. 
<br>
<br>Motivation, by comparison, is the leaves of this grand oak. They come and go, felled by everything from a breeze to being displaced foraging creature. Much like a leaf, motivation is fleeting in it's nature, a fluid thing that changes form at the smallest whim. This is the defining difference between the two mindsets and must be understood before one is to start upon the road of achieving greatness. Once a man has taken this realisation, he can begin the path to mastering his own fate, free of semetic and degenerate influences. He no longer will require strength from outside sources but can find his own, whether from the drive to protect his family or to becoming a man willing to stand for his people.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">So now we understand the fundamental idea behind real self improvement we move onto expanding upon the topic; the reason to fight. Not merely fight in a physical aspect but in what one could potentially term a "spiritual" way. Allow me to explain.
<br>
<br>A man can steel his body, sculpt a perfect example of the European man's true form through hard work indeed. But there needs to be a deeper purpose to it. Merely identifying a deeper purpose is just the first step, it must become an entrenched bulwark for the mind to detect and defend against potential corruption influences (nihilism, ego death etc). Let us begin.
<br>
<br>So, let us state an obvious goal we all share; the protection and propagation of the European peoples and their long term survival in a world of chaos and deeply embedded corruption. Now this sounds a rather grand and sometimes almost impossible feat but the truth is it is much simpler than it first appears. The initial routes to dedication must come from personal aspects and expand from that, the roots must be bedded deep as it were. Therefore a wise decision is to attempt to begin with family or a loved one. As a European man, your role, first and foremost, is the protection of those you hold dear. Blood. Ethnic nation. Race. For some expanding this to your entire racial group is fairly easy, for others it can be challenging, hence this approach. 
<br>
<br>So, how can one protect those he loves? Each person decides different priorities when it comes to this but for the most part in my experience the overarching concepts are;
<br>
<br>- Physical mastery. To become strong enough to protect them in case of attack. It does not need to simply be an immediate threat but a long term threat such as encroaching (((diversity))) or some such. Use that initial fear as a drive. Realise this is a fear to be conquered and overwhelmed by your dedication to physical improvement and sheer will. Once you have begun to improve and grow stronger you will find this fear replaced with instinctive awareness and the fight reflex in place more firmly than before. This is just part of mastering your physical world though for you must also remember the world you live in; food may be plentiful but the items of plentitude are rather vile and poor for you. A man can buy a Big Mac for a couple of pound but if he wishes to buy real meat without hormone treatment or factory farmed you'll be paying a fair bit more. As the old adage goes, you are what you eat so if you wish to master your physical aspects you must first understand the fuel you are taking in. I will expand further on this point at a later date however.
<br>
<br>- A drive to provide stability. Any man of noble spirit and heart wishes to ensure his family and his people deserve a place to rest easy. We are often deprived of this by the hate fuelled semetic parasites who force the outsider upon us in an effort to drive us to the brink. We are forced to live among Negroes, Arabs and assorted other unwelcome offshoots of humanity resulting in a devastation of the European spirit for it is forced to live in a state of constant threat and unending aggression commited against ourselves. Thusly we must forge new homestead and bastions far from the maddening crowd and in order to do that we must provide both financial capabilities and emotional succor in the interim. As a man this is vital and must become a key aspect to any improvements you make, be it for personal or familial reasons. A man can begin the path to /sig/ but if he is trapped within the belly of the beast he can only go so far in such a vile environment. You must become the unmoving mountain of both physical and emotion aspects.
<br>
<br>- Sacrificing the easy. The word sacrifice means to make something sacred. A simple concept is it not. So therefore, despite the association with sacrifice being bad as "muh aztecs human sacrifice", removing poisons of both the physical and mental (e.g. mass media) variety to follow the road of improvement means to literally embrace a path of greatness. You are bombarded at every oppurtunity by semetic poisons, be </div>

You are bombarded at every oppurtunity by semetic poisons, be them poor food quality (soy used in bread production, chemical use for preservatives etc) to (((media))) in the form of movies and music. "Hey goy, listen to this hot new beat consisting of three notes and a nigger screeching ass into a mic for five minutes, isn't it great?))) is an every day thing which no one outside those waking up to the state of things notices. The worst is subtle corruptions, such as placing Negroes in historical European fiction, making the American Civil War all about slavery, how noble ideals of virtue and honour are "dated" but wanting white women to fuck anything *but* whites or embrace ackbars is great. Seperating yourself from these poisons allows greater clarity, your no longer lethargic due to poor food and no longer mentally subdued due to (((media))) bombardment.</div>

<br>By soon I meant like tomorrow. Trying to itemise three years worth of knowledge and studies on semite free self improvement information is a tricky thing. I'm unsure whether to tackle the mental or physical aspects of self improvement first. For instance I could explain the rudimentary rules of weight training and cardio or I could move to the subject of reintroducing the concept of honour and nobility within one's personal manner and character, there's a lot to cover. A billion little strands that need tieing together, i'm struggling to know where to begin.
<br>
<br>Eh, i'll throw down one last aspect of understanding self improvement before resting, mainly as it's prescient for myself after the gym visit tonight. Do not expect instant results. Assuming one has found his inner fire, his will has been strengthed and has finally chosen to improve, the first few weeks can be a true test of this new mindset. Once a program of fitness has been chosen, whichever one it may be (there are a myriad of approaches available) you will find it to be an uphill battle. I'll share a personal anecdote on this one. When my training began after realising what is required of me I threw myself into it the first week. I watched countless videos, read innumerable blogs, discerned what methods fit with my approach and went into it with a glad heart. It was a slog. Your body, the first couple of weeks, is incredibly tired, you ache constantly. You'll wonder why results are taking so long and the first test of resolve is issued; to stick by or surrender. If you surrender then you lack value, to yourself and to those who rely on you, you demean and shame yourself in this action but may try justify it with nihilism or pithy jokes. Initially, I did just that, it didn't seem worth it, I fell into a blackpill stupor that took some effort to get out of. But if you persist, if you refuse to lay down and die you will find results coming bit by bit. That protruding gut no longer appears a piece of sagging flesh but toned muscle. Your shoulders and arms grow, once shirts tight around the gut slacken and your arms now stretch them to a welcoming degree. You'll feel better mentally as well, gaining pride in what your achieving but that achievement will take some time. It won't be instant, not by a long shot. It'll take sweat. It'll take pain. It'll take dedication. But once your in the rythm, once your body is becoming more receptive it grows easier and easier. Upon getting over the hump you'll find results arriving incrementially over time with each one providing a new push towards the herculean goal of achieving your form. One must remember though, this is but a part of what must be done. A perfect body is lacking if it is not tempered by the sharpened mind in the same way a great mind lacks force if the body is weak and flabby. Achieving unison in both is the goal of the Overman. Most will never achieve it, it is a life long goal but it is the pursuit of it that makes it such a noble ideal. True perfection in that regard may not be achievable but that is what makes the challenge one worthy of any son of Europe, be him in the States, a far flung former colony or within the home continent. The strength you'll gain and in turn share with others by inspiring and teaching as a result of this road is something to behold. It may just be the thing that saves us. Remember always, weak men create hard times. Hard times create strong men.</div>

Ego psychology is a Freudian concept from jews pushing ego(self) over the collective(people). Your Volk are you. You are your Volk. There is no self. Selfishness has been ingrained in us. Their strategy is obvious. Those who think of self-preservation lose all connection with their people and they're easily manipulated/coerced. Then is when you become so concerned you may even submit for protection or gibs. Don't do this. Focus on everyone which you share ethnic origin with. "You are your Volk"  must be battered back into the minds of the brainwashed masses, or there will never be a significant enough uprising.</div>

<br>I wholeheartedly agree, I phrased that poorly. A more accurate description of what I was wishing to refer to was the understanding of what the European man's role naturally is within the realm of his thinking, in this case the unyielding spirit and where it once was within the psyche. I'm unsure the exact term of such a thing though, please accept my apologies. 
<br>
<br>As an aside, if there is a particular aspects someone would like discussed regarding the macro level considerations of /sig/ please ask questions, it's a wonderful topic and there is no such thing as a stupid question in this subject. If not i'll just continue trying to muddle through the concepts to the best of my understanding as and when I formulate them to a worthy post.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Has anyone here quit porn completely?<br><br>Let's be blunt, I'm a man and I have needs. I have a need to fuck. I'm not going to stop fapping. I did it for several months before and all that happened was I went really lusty around women who thought I was creepy, had constant awkward boners and jizzed at night during sex dreams so I had to wear underwear to bed. I didn't feel any more energetic or any of that bs, I just felt insanely driven to impregnate a woman.<br><br>Having said that, I do look at porn but that's the part I want to stop. Porn is generally quite sickening or just sad. After watching porn I get a slightly depressed feeling from looking at the ugly shit show that is humanity. Porn in general seems mostly driven by exploitation but more importantly there is no love there and certainly no joy. Even my own memories of having sex with women I'm left with a feeling of how horrible they were, like trash, certainly with no real care for me or perhaps even themselves. I go without porn for maybe a few weeks but then my own imagination isn't cutting it and I've forgotten how sad it really is. I fool myself to think I will see something truly fulfilling and satisfying just to scratch the itch and relieve myself but then I see it and by that time I'm already there and mostly finish to a feeling of disgust. I'm plagued by the thought of a better world where these girls could be happy mothers kissing me with deep appreciation.<br>I've felt this way for years but no matter how many times I walk away from it, I've always gone back. I'm willing to accept this if it's an unavoidable part of my human condition but I was wondering if anyone has achieved permanently quitting?</div>

Now I'd like to talk practically about it, perhaps get some advice from those already doing it.<br><br>Coming off as a horny creep to women is kind of unavoidable, although I will do my best to interact with women as little as possible. I would like to make it clear, I never say anything inappropriate nor make sexual advances but women can just tell when you look at them like a starving man looking at a hot meal.<br>Having said that I'd like some more practical advice, particularly to erections. The wet dreams are pretty easy, as I said before I just wear underwear to bed and washing myself when I wake up just becomes part of my morning routine. However erections happen pretty frequently, probably a minimum of 30 times a day and I once got an extremely embarrassing erection in front of a teenage girl where she brushed my arm and I bent over with my butt out to reposition it to upright under my belt whilst concerned onlookers were asking what was wrong. The longest period I've gone before is about five months so I don't know if any major changes in this area happen after that, but in the mean time, any advice about hiding erections? I'm seriously considering a male chastity penis cage, pic related, but I'm a little concerned about if I suddenly need to urinate in public and people might think I'm some sort of sex freak for wearing one.</div>

I'm surrounded by women at my job. This made talking to them not an issue at all, especially considering how much of an anti-social freak I was throughout Junior High and High School.

  <div class="divMessage">Op here on the subject of import; understanding the Overman.
<br>
<br><span class="greenText">&gt;To forge a man of action.</span>
<br>
<br>In these chaotic times, true men of action are needed. So often we consider our situation almost insurmountable, the semetic enemies weapons innumerable, their golems plentiful. In order to be a Man of Action, a true European, you must, as i've stated in previous threads and posts, embody the Aryan ideal of the Overman. But just what *is* the Overman?
<br>
<br>I could acost you with long winded tales of European heroism and nobility (which is something you should most certainly learn about) but I shall cut to the very heart of the matter; it is you. It is the culmination of wisdom, strength and bravery that lies at the heart of Men of Action. It is one, be him a mighty giant or a short and portly fellow who recognises his weaknesses and fixes it not because he is told to, not because he merely wants to but because it *is* him. 
<br>
<br>In a manner of speaking it's the realisation of just what you are underneath all the follies and vile degeneracy of the modern age. The Overman is a man who does not merely wish change but simply does it. Some would use a (((Hollywood))) trope from some semetic corruption of the idea but the truth is the Overman is what one could term "true" power. His power is not borrowed but attained by him through strife and struggle. 
<br>
<br>Knowledge from learning of events from modern (((media))), Reddit posts or shitty 4cuck threads, these are the hallmarks of a small man. It is from reading literature of old, understanding philosophy from Plato to Evola, scouring Historical texts banned or hidden from public discourse for the truths (((they))) seek hidden that one attains understanding at a level he had not believed possible for it is with this knowledge the European Man attained greatness.
<br>
<br>An Overman does not rely on protein powders or steroids to gain physical strength and mastery, nor does he seek knowledge from jokes of "martial training" like Kike Maga or Brazillian Jujitsu but gains prowess and discipline through true martial training, be it boxing or a real martial art.
<br>
<br>An Overman does not seek temporary relief or succor from things that would poison and weaken such as media or consumption of a product for he can find enjoyment in his own creation, whether through skills such as gardening, carpentry, art or writing. He can break the shackles of the modern degeneracy and in doing so becomes more than a mere man, more than a simple anon on a board. He becomes a true exemplar of what every far flung son of Europe is at his heart; a hero. 
<br>
<br>Yes this is not a path for everyone. It can be lonely, soul crushing at times. You will find yourself torn, struggling to overcome concepts forced upon you and others by the semetic parasites who have taken your future. Your body will ache, your mind will bend but there is a light at the end. There is a strength you never knew you had, a wisdom you did not believe you could possess and in walking the path you do not merely galvanise yourself against the predations of those who seek your demise but you will become a beacon for fellow Men of Action. A light of hope in a world darkened by blood and treachery. You will become the Overman. The European ideal. Others will tell you it's not possible, to merely surrender to nihilism, to take the path of least resistance. But you are better than that. In your veins runs the blood of heroes, men who fought and forged nations for their sons and daughters. It falls to us to reclaim and build upon our birthright. It falls to us to raise our fathers banners once more against the gloaming morass of inhumanity that seek our eternal downfall. We walk this path together, even now with oceans seperating us. Division must end for only in unity can we defend against the coming storm, only in brotherhood can we stand shoulder to shoulder. This is our conflict, a battle for the very soul of our people, there is no retreat for we are the very bulwark that will protect our race from becoming the dust and echoes our enemies wish it to be. We will r</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#71954">&gt;&gt;71954</a><br>Kinda depends on how much time you have. There's no quick way to doing it and everyone is different. Whatever you want to do you have to approach it with balance. If you have no equipment, you can do pushups, situps, pullups and squats. Do the latter on a seperate day. For each of these, especially with squats you want to push yourself. Unless you're completely sedentary your legs are probably a whole heck of a lot stronger than you give them credit for.  <br>Mountain climbers and running are good for building up a sweat, do these on the days you don't do squats or you're going to be harshing on your legs.<br>As for diet, it depends on what your goals are. If you can cut back calorically you'll lose weight. Things like pop and fast food are horrible for your diet because they have an excess of sugars, salts and oils, to keep it simple. They're also the most common dietary vices. The more you can cut down on these the better. I'd recommend trying to make simple, attainable changes, before trying to go full Spartan warrior mode as you'll like get burnt out and just end up despondent. <br>From there if you want to get more serious, I'd recommend checking out the /fit/ boards of 4chan, 8chan, and 7chan. They should have some cumulative amount of resources to at least point you in the right direction to get some better information or give you an idea ultimately of what your ultimate goal will be. <br>There's a board here <a href="/ath/">&gt;&gt;&gt;/ath/</a> that has some good write-ups on the science behind building muscle. But the important things to me are always mental, like you said you need a solid regiment, espcially when you're starting out that you can at the very least maintain, so it needs to be realistic.</div>

<br>You do me great honour by speaking so. There will come a time to lead, the horrors upon us are beyond comprehension at this juncture, from the invasion of our nations by innately hostile golems, the stripping of our cultue and spirit to the mutilation of our children by "social justice" lunatics, the tally grows ever taller. It will fall to us all to be the men our people demand us to be but the question is always when. Wait too long, it will fall apart beyond a fighting chance. Too early you get shut down instantly like many modern movements. 
<br>
<br>I apparently do have a certain cadence to my voice (a subject of chagrin for my wife who claims I sound akin to a World War 1 officer) but from time to time I struggle with addressing larger groups which has cropped up on occassion in my field of expertise. Sometimes despite my ability to speak eloquently with a handful of people I trip over my tongue with more so any advice would be warmly welcomed.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">OP here again, wishing for to discuss a little on the subject of the groundings of a leader.
<br>
<br>In Revolt Against The Modern World, Evola mentions one of the key things for a leader to have is something akin to a divine right. The purpose of this is to cement his leadership beyond what one could possibly term the "physical plane" (I am loathe to use that phrase as it mostly corresponds to modern corruptions of spirituality but it's the only analogue I can think of at this moment). I can certainly see the appeal in this for the modern man is severely lacking in anything beyond the material, the consumption based lives they lead hollow and vaccous so offering something higher could be appealing if applied right but the question is how could such a concept be utilised beyond the classic trappings of modern semetic Christianity or one of it's more openly vile cousins. 
<br>
<br>This "divine right" can take many forms, be it an origin story (see Wotan/Odin and so forth for examples) or some claim of direct communion with a higher power (see modern semetic religions as examples of this) so if one were to contemplate on how to adapt it, what would be the most effective method. I've heard it argued that Adolf himself, while not using this method directly, was considered a man worthy of adulation despite being merely an average gentleman in appearence so one must ask if it was his oratory that led to him being held in such high regard. If one reads his speeches with the correct translations it can be clearly seen his words have a power to them, include a passionate delivery it becomes obvious how it could illicit greatness in the hearts of men and thus it could be argued this was his "divine power" as it were, to lift the soul. I however believe there is something beyond this however. A glance over National Socialist propaganda shows it did not focus on him as a great leader nor any specific of the party itself but of the unbending will of his people, inspiring images of men building and creating, women being the matriarch and providing succor. It could of been easy to paint him as some grand hero in the public eye, warp him to a facsimile of a truly powerful Germanic male and yet in paintings of him it is not power that is portrayed but simply a man of decent bearing. Therefore we must look beyond the singular confines of what we percieve to be leadership in this current epoch which would be a focus on a mere man (Trump is a recent and ill fated example of this) and consider what the man himself is doing.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">If one were to apply the concept of "divine right" while considering all of this I believe the success of Adolf and his message was infact perhaps speaking not merely to the people but speaking directly to the spirit of them or the volk as it were, bringing them together to form not merely a "faith" of what one commonly considers to be a collection of rules and obedience to a single entity but something a strata above that. This is the tool for which any budding leader of men must utilise. Many current "thought leaders", if you can even offer them such a grand term, attempt to do this, speaking of solidarity between the European peoples, speaking of uniting together and yet none can openly offer *positive* change. Oh, of course you'll get the usual "to survive" which is a vital reason but that is a defensive term. It is an attempt at a bulwark but not a vector of pushing forward. What a true leader of men must encompass is not reconfiguring the existing system but an entirely new system with an objective that transcends mere survival. I have written on various occasions on the importance of hope and that is what a positive objective must embody. Without a forward motion our people and our goals can never come to fruition for such a position is static, it is merely holding back the tide, not actively pushing it back. It offers respite, not hope or faith. Any new leaders words must speak directly *to* the European spirit, the grand mass of our people rather than focusing on small pockets of resistance or small objectives. Had Hitler focused efforts solely on ultra nationalists it's likely his movement would of struggled even with the horrors of Weimar, his encompassing of a dream for his people spoke not to them on a personal level but to the spirit that had been shackled by traitors and parasites. In speaking to the spirit of the European peoples this leader does not aquire the "divine right" in himself but creates it within the very people themselves with the leader himself taking the role of awakening it from it's long slumber within every man and woman seeking a future. This must be a lynchpin for any who seek to forge a path, it must be the core tenant at the heart of not merely White wellbeing but to building a future worthy of our people.
<br>
<br>There is no retreat, no bastion that can hold forever. We must always push forward and to do that we must embrace the Spirit of ourselves and our people to do so. We must never rest nor stop, upon victory we must find new challenges and new goals for rest and becoming static will merely allow for the degeneration to repeat and for more atrocities to be put against us. Our children have been brutalised and raped, our women degenerated and used as puppets, our men stripped of nobility and pride. The enemy has attempted to strip us of all hope and crush our spirits, only offering kosher religiosity and "new age" spirituality to flourish for they are easy to control. The true Spirit of Europe must be awoken for only in faith in ourselves and our people can victory be won and a future made manifest.</div>

The Hofbrauhaus, Friday the 15th on August 1920 was were he said, "Here everyone works exactly according to the instincts of his race, because the race, or should we say, the nation and its character, as the Jew himself explains, lies in blood, and this blood is forcing everyone to act according to these principles, whether he is the leading mind in a party that calls itself democratic, or calls itself socialist, or a man of science, literature, or just an ordinary exploiter. <strong>He is a Jew; he works aglow with one thought: How do I get my people to become the Master Race</strong>."<br><span class="greenText">&gt;There is no retreat, no bastion that can hold forever. (etc)</span><br>Yes, I read the rest. What we need though is a leader who's willing to step up and accomplish all of this. Not that I haven't been trying. This jew infested world is a pain in the ass when it comes to making an attempt at gaining a foothold. At least he came across six others who believed as he did, of the German worker's party. I'm constantly unindoctrinating others as they then take flight north when the realization hits.<br><span class="greenText">&gt;"to survive" which is a vital reason but that is a defensive term. It is an attempt at a bulwark but not a vector of pushing forward. </span><br>That works metaphorically. Let's talk literal. If survival was top on Hitler's list, Germany may not have lost. I admire the man for the true inspiring leader he is, but I must also admit the two faults he had. Not setting up extreme defense for his nation, and believing in the kike doctor Theodor Gilbert Morell's prognosis that his "light would go out at any minute". This put survival the furthest from Adolf's mind. What Germany needed was heavily militarized border and coastal forts, anti-aircraft and anti-tank gun emplacements everywhere. What he did was set up German soldiers in defense of other territories to prevent Bolsheviks from invading them. Numbers of soldiers were stretched too thin to defend Berlin, with massive amounts of cowardly faggots from Great Britain, Russia and America ganging up on a nation barely larger than Idaho. In the end, it was a jew's vile propaganda that did him in. That destroyed Germany and they continue to taint Hitler's name with their repulsive lies to this day.</div>

<br><span class="greenText">&gt;Admiration of Evola does not belong here.</span>
<br>I agree with your stance on Evola's personal thoughts on the Reich but it would be foolish for us to ignore his analysis on how leaders are formed. They make for a good basis on which to work from in an effort to evolve the concepts in an effort to ascertain a model that would work in this modern era.
<br>
<br>There's a delicious irony concerning Evola actually, a good portion of his work tracks and teaches of the tools and requirements of a leader and how the world is degenerating and yet when facing the nest of liars and manipulators of the post war period he acted the coward by claiming essentially "I am not a fascist like these other fascists, I am above them all" after which he then lived in obscurity as he allows his work to be mostly forgotten. Seperating the man and his work can be useful as his work is insightful, it's just ashame he doesn't practise what he preaches. I like to think of his work on this topic as a passion project from a man who thought himself brave and went out to learn bravery in it's totality only to find when challenged he could not emulate those he sought to understand.
<br>
<br><span class="greenText">&gt;That works metaphorically. Let's talk literal. If survival was top on Hitler's list, Germany may not have lost.</span>
<br>I agree but only partially. The war Hitler fought was in a time where men, at least some, understood concepts of honour, duty and valour. Many believed in such things even during the first war when even on Christmas day, despite the blood letting, arms were lowered and men joined for a friendly game of football. Modern, underhanded semetic tactics such as infiltration and subversion were not practised by the common soldiery and thusly I think Hitler still operated on the concept he was dealing with actual European leaders, not their parasitic puppet masters. He thought they would see reason and join him in preparing the for Communist forces invasion of Europe. Had he known the truth of how far our nations had fallen, one must wonder how his plans would of changed.
<br>
<br>The other issue is the battle we fight now compared to the battle of then. Both are against a corrosive semetic influence but the battle lines are vastly different. Back then, when the war began Hitler mounted a counter attack that while ill fated and stretched his forces, proved successful, we are in a uphill battle from the outset due to the nature of our conflict compared to his. We have been born into a battle we didn't know we were fighting, the subversion rooted deep. We've been relying on speakers and fringe politicians who fight against it in the open only to see them fail due to the cultural monopoly the parasite has. None of these modern leaders even come close to the men of the past such as Rockwell, Pierce or even Mosley. They shackle themselves out of fear, embarass themselves by lacking credulity. This is why it's important to understand the environment from which a leader can emerge and for us to go on the offensive to help *create* it, that must be our goal. Our message must reach those who have suffered at the hands of the beast, be they the lowly man working in a shoe factory to the highest echelons who have watched their surrounding community and culture die. It is from these ranks the men we need may arise but only if they know what is needed. I can even cite two modern example of this, ableit a poor one and an adequate one.
<br>
<br>Let us look for a moment at National Action, the ill fated and sadly anti life movement that emerged in Britain. It held rallies openly naming the tribe and recruited directly from the working class, their ranks swelled quite a bit considering. They proved successful to a degree in rallying, however they also had multiple serious issues, the first one being a completely controlled organisation. Now I know some like to claim "no man, we werent controlled op, we were legit m8". Let me make it abundantly clear, they were not a natural movement.

<br>Let us look for a moment at National Action, the ill fated and sadly anti life movement that emerged in Britain. It held rallies openly naming the tribe and recruited directly from the working class, their ranks swelled quite a bit considering. They proved successful to a degree in rallying, however they also had multiple serious issues, the first one being a completely controlled organisation. Now I know some like to claim "no man, we werent controlled op, we were legit m8". Let me make it abundantly clear, they were not a natural movement. Every member found themselves on a list, *every* member. The second issue with them, as if the first main one isn't enough was their focus on the nihilistic nature of the movement. They wanted change, of course. But what they presented had no method of doing so. A brief look at their imagery or appearence reveals much, the stylised symbol of the movement, the corruption of Mosley's smartly dressed Black Shirts into hoodies and black jeans, their entire appearence was the corruption of positive aspects. No Men of Action, only Men of Death. They had an ideal of giving Britain back to the British only they failed to understand that their appearence and actions was merely a tool for the parasite to use to *supress* such a thing. But people kept flocking any way as they were the only group at that juncture doing it. Young working class men had something to believe in, they had a goal that aimed around doing something even if it was nebulous and unfocused beyond "fuck kikes". Had they the foresight to realise they were becoming puppets, well, let us just say hindsight is always 20/20.
<br>
<br>Now to compare to another movement, namely Scottish Dawn. It is claimed that they had ties to NA, something that would allow the parasite to deploy the system into full shut it down mode however they had a few marked differences. Initially SD utilised a system similar to Golden Dawn with voluntary community improvements such as clearing the countryside of garbage and various other local projects. At first, it began with a few hundred and gained momentum in a short time among the working class in a similar vein to NA only with a focus initially on Scottish nationalism. The very sybmol they used was the life rune, a reflection of these values. However, much like most modern movements, it seems to of been infiltrated and eventually became NA lite. A brief look at this video is a good demonstration what with the moody visuals, the forboding music and the "FCK ISIS" hoodies. It was a devolution into the anti life nihilism of NA.
<br>
<br><span class="spoiler">h</span> ttps://<span class="spoiler">w</span> ww.bitchute.com/video/OTMlklCnkfTh/
<br>
<br>When considering both of these movements there is a clear demonstration there are those willing to stand and to make a change. The issue is the need for a true leader for them to rally around which is why I promote so heavily for a informational offensive that would get the truth of the situation in the hands of these men and for someone with the wisdom, Will and foresight of what is needed to lead them from a higher echelon. Someone who understands the dangers of negative imagery and nihilistic rage and can turn it into a positive change for which men can follow to victory and glory. If you offer these men mere survival some may see that as something impossible as your merely resisting. But to offer not merely survival but an objective goal at changing their fates, well, then you offer them something more. There is little glory in survival, of course there is a nobility in the concept of sacrifice to make it happen but men yearn for something beyond being remembered simply for that. They want to know they made a tangible change to a dying system. We must offer them that.</div>

National Action though, anyone named <strong>Benjamin</strong> (his last name Raymond) I <em>do not trust</em>. I agree with the majority of your message. National Socialism has been aligned with false images of darkness and false accusations of violence and atrocities for too long. The message needs to be positive. Anyone shilling violence and "terrorist actions" needs to be shunned completely. If Hitler is permitted to be viewed in classes or the public eye, it's always untranslated German which the masses don't commonly understand and when he was furious. It's never when he spoke calmly. His messages are not permitted publicly because they're afraid. Millions of Germans did not follow a "dark, brooding, angry leader". They followed a man offering positive change. One who actually made that happen and was appreciated by the German people. This type of event hasn't happened since. I'm reminded of Patrick Little who claimed he was running for the Presidency. Though his entire message was always true and pointed out kikery to the public, he gave up, whined about his wife (kissed Putin's ass) and forfeited his run. We need a leader with an indomitable will offering the positive, not a furious mob of rage fueled calls to violence which are easily villainized by the mainstream media, banned and discarded.</div>

<br>The situation facing Scotland is quite dire, I retreated to a more secluded forgotten spot in the south west of these darkened isles but i've been keeping up with what affairs I can. Scotland, as it stands, has condemned itself. It's choice is either stand with the SNP who are insistent on joining the EU and we all know how diversified it will find itself in that event thanks to the cash for migrants deals the semites will push (not that Sturgeon would need pushing). The other is follow Westminister who will do to the Scots what they did to the English; complete identity erasure. It's only a matter of time until Robert the Bruce or some such figure is hung from the branches of equality as a heretic. Also the state of speech up there is appalling from all reports, arrests for merely revving an engine "threateningly" at a Muslim and such. Throw in the finances being centralised to Edinburgh and it's a real shit show, most villages and poorer suburbs are now either being abandoned, filled with migrants or drugs or both in many cases. 
<br>
<br>Wales and N. Ireland seem fairly forgotten compared to Scotland in all of this but thats hardly surprising. Considering how industry was executed in Wales, all thats left is rotting small villages left to suffer or a blood rivalry in N. Ireland fermented by traitors on each side. Mixed in between all of this is groups of "Loyalists" beseeching for unity under the banner of the Union Jack who fail to understand the Empire lays dead and we will too unless we reforge either as brothers in a united cause (actual brothers, not singular control from the cesspit of London) or individual countries finding their own future. I would rather unity with true power sharing rather than singular power but I know I am an outlier with such thinking thusly I would happily settle for complete dissolution. I know the wounds run deep and the sins we English carry are indeed heavy, trust must be earned by a hand of friendship rather than the bloodied blade our "leaders" once enjoyed. Whether we can either regain our honour and nobility to earn such trust for a truly unified Britain is a question i've not been able to answer for some years now.
<br>
<br>As an aside, a mans blood will always yearn for his far off homelands and you honour your lineage by respecting it as you do. I do not know if it helps but I will be visiting some of the western islands of Scotland later in the year (Jura etc), if you so wish I can leave a message or a marker on your behalf (I would advise it be ambigious) in a region. I know in these dark times we can feel isolated from our history so if you would like something recorded and placed in a quiet corner I will endeavour to do so. All I ask is if you do wish it, it should be something not identifiable directly. Even the most careful of men can be caught out with a single careless word or item.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">While I normally post more in depth views on /sig/ and so forth, for tonight I shall be sharing some recipes for a more light hearted offering. I am still unable to post images so instead I shall share the old fashioned way. These are some special ones I recovered from some archival old Vienna gourmets cook book from around a century ago, both of which are rather tasty as a pleasent treat. Do enjoy and remember; you are what you eat so avoid the modern poisons and savour the best you can get. These are good and hearty dishes and chosen specifically for the simplicity of them (for gourmet cooking their simple), if it's of interest i'll gladly share some of the more in depth ones at some point also.
<br>
<br>- Viennese Goulash (Wienersaft Guly√°s)
<br>Crush together 2 teaspoons marjoram (failing that oregando will suffice, 2/3 tablespoon of oregano equals 1 tablespoon of marjoram) 1 teaspoon of caraway seeds (if lacking this try anise or fennel) and finely chopped lemon rind and 1 clove of garlic. In a large saucepan combine 3/4 cup of butter, 1 teaspoon of tomato paste and the crushed seasonings.
<br>
<br>Add 2 pounds of peeled onions, sliced, and sautee them, stirring constantly until golden. Add 1 tablespoon of sweet Hungarian paprika (it's like regular paprika with a touch more sweetness) and cook the onions, stirring constantly, for half a minute more. Add 2 pounds of beef -chuck, rump or round- cut into large same sized chunks, 1 cup of water and a pinch of salt. Cover the saucepan tightly and let simmer until the beef is tender, about hour and half should do it. Add a little more water during cooking only if needed.
<br>
<br>Just before the goulash is done, add 1/2 cup of water and let the sauce boil up once. If more sauce is preferred, sprinkle it with 1/4 cup of flour just before the water is added at the end and add 1 more cup of water.
<br>
<br>- Ham Pockets (Schinkentaschen)
<br>
<br>Sift 2 cups of flour with 1/4 teaspoon of salt onto a bread board. Make a well in the center of the flour and in it put 1 cup of butter, 1/2 pound of creamcheese and 1 egg yolk. Work the center ingredients into the flour to make a smooth dough. Chill the dough for one hour. 
<br>
<br>Saut√© 2 medium onions, finely chopped, in 1 tablespoon of butter. Remove the pan from the heat and mix the onions well with 1/2 pound of ham, chopped, 2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of mustard, 1 teaspoon of paprika (hungarian or regular) and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. 
<br>
<br>Roll the dough out 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured board, cut it into 2 inch squares, and on top of each square place a teaspoon of filling. Pinch the corners of the squares together over the filling and press together the edges of the dough to seal them. Bake the ham pockets on an unbuttered baking sheet on a moderate heat (350f/180c) for 15 minutes or until the pastry is nicely browned. Serve hot. Makes for about 6 dozen.
<br>
<br>Are these dishes particuarly good for gains? Not entirely. Are they particuarly bad for you<span class="cyanText"> Eh, carbs in the Ham Pockets but y'now. Do these make for a pleasent occasional treat for a man on the path of /sig</span> Most certainly. Challenging yourself not just in body, spirit and mind is important and thus learning skills such as preparing a meal worthy of yourself is just as important. Remember, it's the effort you put in that makes the final results all the better in all things, having a fine treat once in a while can lift the spirits of any man.</div>

I'm not sure it would matter if you placed markers across western islands of Scotland. What would be of more benefit is reporting back here with any news of non-immigrant locations. I long for my ancestral homeland, but then there's the Public Order Act of 1986 holding a 7 year prison sentence for "hate speech". I very much doubt native Scots are protected under the law. It's to punish those who wish to have their land for their people. And I'm incapable of not revealing international jewry for what it is. When America's 1st amendment is finally pozzed and people are being tossed in prison en masse, that's about when I'll give up and move to Scotland. The entire world will be ruined by then. Not that the U.S. isn't a grand display of ruin already. When the eventual removal of our freeze peach happens as it has across European nations, there will be no reason to speak out anymore. At that time I might struggle to keep my thoughts to myself and settle down, waiting for the door to door guillotine service for not accepting the mark of "David". <span class="spoiler">Saturn in ancient cuneiform, Remphan, Chiun, Moloch, etc. Beast gods of human sacrifice.

<br>There are some pockets of untouched populations, all of which follow a similar theme to what can be found in both England and Wales, namely financial barriers. The more affluent villages (usually made affluent by higher end farms breeding specialised cattle and so forth or have a unique tourist trait) have house prices usually around ¬£300,000 and above which coincides with very close knit communities all of whom own decent chunks of the surrounding land, this all acts as a bulwark, at least for the most part. Up until a few years ago some of the western Scottish islands were relatively untouched, they did suffer from poor economy however the geographical isolation meant very limited access for drugs and other corrosive elements. They were mostly older people with the young flocking to the cities at around a 50% rate I think it was, give or take. It wasn't enough to maintain the smaller towns but if careful planning had been done by local councils it could of actually been made to work by simply downsizing however the SNP and Westminster at the time pushed for something different. What instead happened was a dumping of several thousand migrants in these smaller, outlying towns and villages of old Scotland which mostly consisted of older people. 
<br>
<br>I remember one particular one was Rothesay. A small island, not much work as most of the people were of an older generation but relatively peaceful, it wasn't particuarly affluent *but* it did have a community. A friend of mine had family there and recalled many a summer where he would visit his grand parents, it had poor weather but the people were content and despite being out the way they had eachother. Well, in 2015, three thousand "Syrian refugees" were dumped there. On this small island. With a small community. The results? Well it's the same tale as so many once peaceful pockets; it fell apart. It began slowly from all accounts, some discontent, some arrests for "naughty thoughts" being posted as is now the standard in these darkened isles. But as time went on, so did the poison. It began with some sporadic robberies, a violent attack once in a while but soon, mysteriously, drugs arrived in significant numbers, more than had been recorded previously. Discussions on this were scrubbed around 2017 when it came to light, mostly in comment sections now moderated to the extremes but it painted a dark yet familar picture. You see, the migrants got bored. They expected, as the semetic parasites had promised them, entertainment, a free ride. Only instead they found a small, quiet community composed mostly of the elderly wishing to live out their lives in relative peace. Thusly, these people found themselves at the mercy of these "migrants". These same migrants even got hand outs the locals had no access to, special treatment in the form of free cash lump sums, even a small "music festival" was arranged to buy these people, I joke not, new iPhones. All of this, in a community that had been three thousand people, most of whom were elderly, all of which were "easy pickings" for these deranged, incestual golems. What is Rothesay now? It's hard to say, much like any place that has had "vibrancy" inflicted upon it the story remains untold. The last I heard it had degenerated further but most of it is swept under the rug. This is sadly a tale not isolated to this community. It has happened again and will keep happening until men find their Will once more.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">So, where to secure a location. At this juncture, your best bet for a hold out in my opinion is;
<br>
<br>Scotland - The rugged Highlands. Just above Fort Augustus there are a myriad of smaller lochs with a number of small hamlets. Building out in these areas can prove difficult however with a moderate budget it is feasable if you cannot find available locations. The best advice I can give is to seek somewhere with an exceedingly small population with very limited external connections. It will make some purchases and logistics strenous but the payoff is isolation in which you can operate as you wish. There is many a nook and cranny a cunning man could live and even build anew within. Knowing Gaelic can be a bonus the further north you go as it's more prominent (as it should be) but it is not an overt requirement. One thing of note I would add is thanks to media, many Scots when they hear of an American who has Scottish heritage may roll their eyes. This is mainly due to the deluge of "comedians" who the parasite has employed to ensure no brotherhood can be formed (the same is employed to ensure division among internal groups in Britain as well, such as north and south of England etc). Americans as an example are presented by (((Scottish))) comedians as "fat and lacking culture so they come to take ours" along side usual caricatures of a fat man wearing a Haiwain shirt with a fanny pack and a camera. The key to counter is simply to act and present yourself in a respectful way (but I think anyone reading this already understands such things, this is merely for anyone passing by wondering the situation).
<br>
<br>Wales - Wales is a sad story. Many of it's once proud and welcoming villages lay precariously between poverty and ruin. However it is in the more northern and northwestern coastal regions one may find a pocket with some life left in it to make a stand, the coast by Snowdonia is most beautiful also, a man could find peace there. As an Englishman I have always had a budding respect for those I would call brother and the tale of what was done to Wales by a country who should of been it's kin is a shame that weighs heavy. They are a noble people we abandoned and a very proud people still. If anyone does wish to move there I would advise learning Welsh both as a sign of respect and for sheer utility. I know the respect part is not really needed to be added but it's just for those unaware of the importance of their language to them and for awareness of avoiding insult to anyone unfamiliar. It is used quite widely in street signs and general conversation and is quite a pleasent language to know.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">England - My homeland. A land beset by conceited hatred of brothers enforced by Westminster, corrupted by the disease of unbridled finance from London yet somehow it grew to forge an Empire. An Empire dead by it's own greed and zealous self hatred of it's own kin driven by parasites and their lackeys. There are a few hold out areas, oddly the Scottish and Welsh border regions offer some pockets of defensive locations. The north of England suffered much like Wales did when it's industry was hung by Thatcher after the unions were infiltrated by semetic gaunts however there remains areas just north of the Yorkshire Dales one can find villages relatively peaceful. Just above the Northumberland National Park there are also some good locations worth securing also, old forgotten pockets of England. If one were so look south the areas to the north and west of Dartmoor make for good spots. Areas around Exmoor can also prove to be sparsley populated which can also provide a haven as well as offering significant access to cultural history.
<br>
<br>Northern Ireland - A land I am sadly lacking in knowledge in "diversity" wise (although their folk tales are magnificent). What limited knowledge I know suggests areas just west of Lough Neagh can make for a decent retreat. The disease spreading through N. Ireland according to colleagues is focused out of Belfast but i'm afraid my knowledge is sadly lacking. 
<br>
<br>As a general rule of thumb when assessing where to move I would advise the following options;
<br>
<br>- Seek geographical isolation. It makes the job harder but it also makes for greater odds of avoiding both the disease of "diversity" and it's proponents.
<br>- The further away from a significant hub, the better. You'll be hard pushed to not find a large mosque and shitskin section in any city within Britain. Consider this patient zero in an infectious disease situation. The further you are from a mosque the better. The same rule applies for a synagogue or local jewish place of worship, if they are present it's always for a reason. In the infectious disease situation they are the virus turning the patient into an animal.
<br>- Be sure to have rudimentary skills concerning house maintenance. You do not need a full understanding of every facet but basic skills concerning repairs electrical outlets and plumbing can be exceedingly helpful in isolated areas. Isolation has it's pro's but it also has it's cons and this is one of them.
<br>- Prepare to get dirty. Gardening can be a wonderful skill and basic skills concerning growing simple crops, while not vital, is *always* a good thing. It grants you pride in your achievements and means you can be at least partially self sufficient, a most definate useful skill if you seek to isolate to a significant degree.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Ah, a correction must be made concerning Rothesay. It was reported as 15 families which is correct but it also failed to report the other 900 individuals which bought the grand total to around 1,050 to 1,200 at last estimation onto an island of 6,500 with unconfirmed reports of several hundred more being moved there a year later according to rumour, the three thousand figure was a mix up by me. It should also be noted upon arrival the refugees were granted the main church hall of Rothesay as a migrant center and in an ironic twist the SNP actually initiated further cuts to the local infastructure supporting the elderly population after this event.</div>

It's equal to $382,504 and 50 cents. Affluent houses in America cost in the millions. Though the idea of building my own home in a small loch is more appealing. Some cozy cabin design, possibly adding a gathering hall near it later. I'm familiar with woodworking and gardening. My youth was in putting up sheetrock by measurements, spackling and working in a nursery (for plants not babies). Not tree felling though, nor electrical or plumbing. Might be a good idea to try trade schools on those first, as well as learn Goidelic Gaelic from a tutor. An empire dead by greed, self hatred, parasites and their lackeys is the very definition of the USA as well. Seems the entire world is in the hands of jewish bloodsuckers, yet most pockets of resistance are controlled. There needs to be one that isn't, yet grows exponentially similar to how the NSDAP did. The old methods should be applied to modern times, but never strictly online. That achieves nothing, as I've long known.</div>

<br>America may be now a corpse puppet much like Britain but it was a nation forged by heroes. Men of unyielding Will that charged bloodied and harried into a wilderness hostile to their very being with pockets of natives who when not consuming psychedelics enjoyed rape and butchery of local wildlife. No matter what the tribe and their lackeys do, never let that be taken away from you. Modern America may be dead but the forging of an entirely new nation from dirt and heroism is one of the noblest endeavours any wayward son of Europe has ever achieved. Things may be grim but the true spirit of America and those who forged her can never be truly crushed.
<br>
<br>As for groups however, it is a tricky thing. 
<br>NSDAP had an advantage in that media was a lot more limited in it's influence so that people would see the degeneracy but the media spin was fairly isolated to print. It was certainly still present, the parasite still manipulating where it could but it did not permeate every corner. What we face now requires true Men to stand, the who and how of it is... elusive. Our foes also have a myriad of tools, the key I believe is to deprive them of these, to remove them systematically to force a confrontation on the terms of whatever group takes a stand. The online component as you rightly point out is indeed static thusly is highly limited in what it can do and limiting to the individuals who partake, it's why /sig/ and any pro active components are so vital to building a foundation for Men of Action to emerge. 
<br>
<br>As an example of pro active movements the Rise Above Movement while indeed related to the alt kike and likely infiltrated seems to of had the hammer dropped on it far harder than other alt kike components which demonstrates the innate fear of sons of Europe aligning with positive goals in mind. A more refined model of them could potentially prove useful if utilised in a wiser and subtler fashion. Preferably without the latent failings or homosexuality  of the RAM group. Mayhaps make the group a simple concept, improvement based upon the European ideals. While it would indeed "catch flak" for merely being *based* upon European ideals by the parasites media entity it has enough wriggle room by it's nature to lay foundations in a similar vein to the now cuckolded medieval fighting clubs. Of course it would need to be far less LARPy and present itself in a respectable manner but it could be a good breeding ground for men with similar ideals. There is issues with this however, namely finance and the ability to actually have a working group of trustworthy men, something exceedingly hard in an age where the parasites way of living by subversion and cowardice is becoming a recognised standard of living.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">OP returning once more, apolagies for brief absense after July 4th. Upon the subject of hope and faith.
<br>
<br>Hope is a subject of contention more often than not. To dare to hope, to dare to believe is often one of the most cruellest things for hope by it's nature is transitory. It can be struck down by a single flip of the coin and be used to sunder the soul of the strongest man by those with vile intentions. We have all, at one point or another, had our hope stricken and decended into the "black pill" as it were, ensconsed within the grim cage of nihilism as the will to fight turns to dust and our very spirit lay broken. The weight of it all stays our feet, the shimmering flame of resistance faltering as gusts of chill wind runs through our very core. It feels pointless to stand, our vision blurs as we try to find a new path forward only to reveal naught but more darkness. This is the cruel nature of hope and it's innevitable loss.
<br>
<br>This is why a man needs faith. Not faith in the guise of religious dogma nor blind adherence to a singular entity but faith in both ourselves and our people. Faith simmers hotter than hope, it can grow from a mere flickering flame to a blazing inferno that can warm the spirit of the man who holds it even in the coldest and darkest of nights. Oh, of course it can be broken, it can be destroyed but *only* if the faith is placed wrongly. If one carries faith based upon something disprovable it is bound to end in disaster. But if faith is placed not merely in a deity or a single idea but rather into something real, something demonstratable, then it can achieve great things. This is why faith is needed not simply in our people recognising the threat to themselves but rather in ourselves and those who understand our struggles, those brothers in far off lands who despite the parasites propaganda and machinations still embrace those who stand with them whoever they may be. We have believed in ourselves as Men. We have believed in ourselves as Europeans. I have said before and I will say again, we have before us the greatest battle any sons of Europe have ever faced, a battle that goes beyond mere bloodshed, it is a battle for the very soul of our people. Every day the struggle grows harder, our enemy close in on us seeking to silence for any man with the Will to stand, any Man willing to make his voice heard in protection of his people is a threat of incalculable proportions to them. The parasite knows one man can change the course of a nation, can change the course of history. It is with the strength of faith in ourselves and faith in brothers forged upon the anvil of this age we can build anew.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">It is frightening. It can be overwhelming. You like I are deliberately isolated and made suspicious of eachother and have doubt in ourselves for the parasite is skilled in dividing and corrupting. But there is a counter to this. You, the few men who read this and understand of what I speak yet sometimes falter for fear takes you, you are the men who need faith, this Will. There are many here who no doubt understand all this already but there are even more who do not. There is a reason Christian faith wanes in this modern age within the European man for his faith is unrewarded, he seeks succor yet is only offered "embrace the negro" or "wash the third worlders feet as you are kind" by their leaders within the church. He is lost for he knows this is wrong but he dare not speak for he fears his tongue will be removed should he. It is why we must believe in ourselves and those like us to stand amid the ruins of this decrepit age. It is why we must never lose faith in what we can achieve for our goal is, to use a slightly religious term, "righteous" for it is nothing less than the survival and unification of brothers against countless forces. Finance. Media. Politics. Even kinsmen who have been lost completely to the parasite. By knowing what must be done, by knowing we can never cease, never rest, by accepting that gladly within our hearts we must accept that this burden requires more than mere determination but a complete and resolute faith that *you* and those like you have the strength and will to do what must be done and speak what must be spoken. There will be some who fall by the wayside. Some who lack the strength or Will to fight, who give in to the darkness. But if you build a wall of faith strong enough against the forces of despair then much like as I spoke of inspiring men to stand in a previous post, you will give those around you faith in themselves, that they can embody the same thing you do. 
<br>
<br>Have faith in your honour. In knowing you are a protector, a bearer of a truth unknown and despite our enemies we will succeed. There is no other choice but to succeed. You are the vanguard and the rearguard. There is no tougher challenge and no greater honour for any man willing to take that stand.
<br>
<br>Have faith in your strength. Strength to not merely fight physically should a need arise but the strength to carry on should all seem lost, to carry the burden where other brothers have fallen. Have faith in yourself to do this, that you can achieve the herculean tasks before you for in doing so the parasite can never slow you down.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Have faith in your nobility. The European Man is an exemplar of what an unbridled spirit can achieve. Forging nations anew. Scientific feats thought impossible. Turning dreams to reality. We are the sons of men who fought and survived countless dark hours. You may believe yourself weakened or corrupted in some form by this modern age, mayhaps have surrendered in one aspect or another to modern degeneracy currently or in the past. But below that hidden away is the spirit of European nobility. Take heart in that and hold faith in that part of you for it is that faith in yourself and your forefathers that can help you conquer any semetic poisons inflicted upon you. Be noble in aspect and spirit, embrace it for that is not merely your birthright but your very nature.
<br>
<br>Have faith in your brothers. You are not alone in this conflict even if it can feel so. All around Europe and her far flung colonolies there are men much like you, seeing the stagnation of our future and the tendrils that are burrowing into it to poison it further. Together we will build a new tomorrow. Every small action, be it a simple meme on social media or a propaganda sticker in a bars lavatory, builds the tiniest bit of momentum. Some have moved past that and are attempting other things but every action of resistance shines a light towards truth and thusly it should not be discouraged. We will march on, alone for now but soon arm in arm. Our aim, European brotherhood, demands we strive. Demands we struggle for the very lifeblood of our people. Together we will build a future worthy of our sons and daughters. Together we shall retake our destiny and build a better tomorrow, this I *know* for history has told this story before. The players are different and the enemies tools are changed but there is one thing that is the same; Us. We of the lost generations march on, we have watched our nations and civilisation die ignobly. It is time to regain faith in ourselves, the brothers who walk with us and in the spirit of our people. 
<br>
<br>Until victory be won.</div>

You could begin a movement and ensure it isn't pozzed at all like the jewish-ADL financed German American Bund or Frank Cohen+Dan Burros American "Nazi" Party. Simply by not permitting any jews at all, ever. No exceptions. Train your vocal chords every day, and everyone will cease their conversations as you speak aloud. I have done this and I'm asked to make public speeches for my job from time to time. What I lack is the swift memory of youth. Everything I provide on this board is from saved texts and site links that took some digging through all the deceptive jew bullshit. I can find what to say through those, as I'm given more than enough time to do so. In person, my memory has waned. A leader of such a movement that might potentially bring our people out of the jewish quagmire should be able to call up inspiring speeches such as yours at the ready.</div>

Within the grim lands of Albion I have... struggled to find men of a solid stock in these dark days. The British people as a whole have become despondent and lackluster. The fire that once forged an empire has died and the inheritors of the ashes have become either fat through self indulgence and apathy or blinded by the unending media of the parasite. In truth I am finding myself becoming apathetic towards them and repeatedly forcing myself to gently nudge what few I believe may have some steel towards truths they know but are unwilling to admit is beginning to grow tiresome. I shall march on regardless, as we all do, there is no retreat nor respite but the soul grows weary. One can only listen to the adulation of "Based Boris" and repeat for the umpteenth time if he is indeed "based" then why did he call himself an "ardent zionist" and offer amnesty to the morass of third world creatures that stormed in without even the usual pretense of "legal immigration". I believe I may take a break from dealing with them and focus on the concepts I share here, mayhaps it will allow some self reflection and insight by externalising the process in text form.<br><br>There is one avenue I am considering though of potentially scouting some "nationalist" meetings within our shores but I am doubtful to find anything beyond MI5 and alt kike shitposters. It would also mean breaking cover which is distinctly unappealing for such a poor trade off. No doubt it'll happen eventually, I would just it rather be for our cause than for watching Degenerate Woes announcing he's now the first alt kike lgbt activist or some such. I am sure among the line members attending there are elements which are sincere and perhaps worthy of attention but it's hard to tell often, especially in a nation where it's people are so hesitant to name the parasite. Maybe I'm being too harsh on them though. My gut however says it would achieve little.</div>

My intention was always to free their minds from parasitic indoctrination. However, as I thought my work Gmail account was terminated due to it being linked to strikes on YouTube videos; on further reflection I'm beginning to suspect a coworker I thought I woke up as a traitor. The disgust on his face was more genuine than his honeyed words of passive agreement. The reward I kept seeking has been connection with a small amount of individuals capable of maintaining mindsets against the tribe. What it actually results in is white flight. Maybe they feel as I do and are spreading the message. I can only hope. Meanwhile, I'll keep trying to find enough people to start a movement. All that's needed is to gain the slander of the local press, and more will join. The larger we become, the larger the press slander, until reaching the pinnacle. Some problems exist. I could be terminated by mass media demand, either my profession or my life; I may be arrested on trumped up charges by ZOGbot police; or one of those FBI raids where they kill everyone and insist it was "terrorism". I understand your complacency and feel the same way sometimes. It's hard to bring forth strong feelings about fighting back when international jewry has such overwhelming control. When every time I attempt to release someone from their brainwashing outside of imageboards, they flee to protect their future or stay and refuse to accept the truth. It's tiresome.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#72450">&gt;&gt;72450</a><br>I do <strong>not</strong> recommend the raw meat diet due to there being blood-borne contagions and even animals have their versions of immuno-deficiency viruses. However, during an archaeology course I took, they compared the remains of three ancient civilizations. This was in 2010. I don't even remember the details anymore, just that those with pure plant-based diets (by necessity) had the most skull lesions which was a sign of malnutrition, those in locations where they'd get partial meat and partial vegetation were less skull lesions and the primary meat eaters had the least. Of course these days we have vitamin supplements. I don't care whether you're a vegetarian like Hitler or a meat eater, personally. To each their own diet as long as it's not in excess towards grotesque obesity.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Thank you kindly to the mod who deleted the posts requested, it is greatly appreciated!<br><br>Upon the topic of the fairer sex; Women.<br><br>In this dying age of degeneracy and misery, Men have forgotten the true role we hold within the dynamic of relationships. Our duty, our place, is that of the stalwart guardian and the guiding hand. Despite what modern women would have you believe, they are vulnerable, terribly so, within both the physical and emotional aspects. They do not always wish trinkets nor material desires but rather a much simpler proposition; someone who sees their weakness, understands it, and be willing to protect them. They may play the strong, the whorish, the tomboy, but at heart all proper women are the same, they seek a bulwark against those who would prey upon them. Women, like the wounded and fearful MGTOW, have been victims of the parasite, their role in balancing a Man's strength and drive blurred by subversion within popular media and culture. Gone is the pride of family, of love for her kin and a yearning for offspring, in it's place is confusion and a petulant rage at perceived slights endorsed and supported by the semetic powers. There is no greater community for her to be a part of with other families, there is no protector for her or for her to offer kindness and succor to (the tempering a mans wild heart being a core tenant of female ideals), all that is left is self adulation and whoredom and when a woman walks this path she fills the unending loneliness and emptiness with more and more degeneracy only for her to become miserable and hollow as time runs on, the lie of hedonism revealing itself fully.<br><br>She is lost and alone in this epoch for she has been told not to seek men who would fulfill her, to find completion with, instead she is guided to the basest of existences only to find herself broken as time waxes on, fulfillment forever out of reach. In it's place she witnesses the withdrawn MGTOW, the bearded man children within media, the vain and vacous "chads" and the adulation heaped upon shitskins and negroes by media leading to finding herself confused as so many have for the Man she truly seeks she cannot find within the world she is offered. Thusly we must lead by example regarding our fair sex. We must lead with strength, nobility and honour in our actions for that is what they *need*. Only in doing so will European Men not merely find the woman they seek but can find peace in a time of strife, finding the true warmth of love and the strength it can grant. Do not go hunting for just any woman though but seek the *right* woman. It will take time, years perhaps but as long as you can demonstrate that you are a guardian against her fears when you find her then she will love you truly. The MGTOW will tell you she is not worth it and to just self indulge and be hedonistic. The semite will tell you idolise the outsider for finding beauty among your own is evil. The pick up artist will tell you their all whores and to just fuck as many as possible. They are all liars. They just need you to be strong and wise within your interactions. Of course a woman can love certain aspects of ones personality but these aspects must be rooted within an iron Will and demonstrated with plans and actions towards a future goal. If a man has these then she is far more likely to stand by him for she understands come what may, the man will never buckle, never laze around on his laurels and in turn she herself has a drive to be part of that future, the paths intertwining forever more.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">One more thing to help you understand what heights you may acquire by taking to heart what I have said here, this is assuming you understand the heart of the woman you love and know she is true to you fully. There is no greater pride than the moment you first hold your child in your arms. In their face you see your future, your legacy. You see your peoples existence fortified just a little bit more against the forces arrayed before them. There is no greater love than holding your wife as you both share that moment of looking at your child for the first time and finding your heart swelling with pride, for the woman you love and the new life you have created together. It is a moment that can never be forgotten nor stolen for it stands as a monument, a summit upon which stands a symbol of a Man's greatest achievement. It grants strength untold in that moment, it truly does.<br><br>Please. Do not forsake all women for they are just like many of us can be. They are afraid, far more so than we understand. Only the bitter and the hateful would claim otherwise. Yes, some women are truly despicable, corrupted beyond hope. But most? Most just want a man who can protect, who represents what a Man truly is. Not some soy fueled man child, not some mid 20's layabout sitting in his pants watching super hero movies and playing video games all the time. Reflecting upon all of this, it makes one think on the old truism of women being like children and how it is partially true. She needs you to be something beyond just a man, just a standard figure. She needs you to be her hero, much like when a little girl hears in a fairy tale with knights years later as a woman she still hopes and dreams of finding for her love embodying those virtues. She needs you to be what you should be. A protector. Her champion. She needs you to embody all that a true Man is. Not a subservient simp or a weakling self indulgant layabout but a true Man of Action.</div>

That anon's message could stand to be more watered down for nor¬≠mies so they wake up gradually. We're already aware.

I know when the old holocaust-is-a-hoax thread was shown to a member of my family, they freaked the fuck out about the word "kike". Nothing else was in that thread to trigger them, yet they wouldn't accept a damn thing. Nor¬≠mies view the truth differently. Falsely. They're sensitive little bitches. You have to treat them with kid gloves or you lose trying to unindoctrinate the retards. What was beautiful about your message was how it could appeal to the masses. I admire Hitler, obviously. Though with your previous post before the images were changed, one look at him and they'd shit their pants uncontrollably due to the bullshit they've been brought up to believe. The message is already known to us. The intent needs to be to wake up more people. Gradually the nor¬≠mies can come to realize Hitler was a great man after they accept other truths.<br>The trouble is Strasserists. People exists who are aware of jews responsible for this or that, but then a Strasserist comes in (who's just another Communist) and subverts those who don't know shit about Hitler. Painting him as a traitor, claiming Zionists and National Socialists loved each other, all kinds of stupid BS. It's difficult enough to bypass all the other lies without those asshats throwing a wrench in everything. The jewish goal of de-nazification continues through their 7th decade of nonstop subversion and blindsighting. We all need to wake up as many people as we can.<br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#72467">&gt;&gt;72467</a><br>I believe this message could be an excellent start towards waking people up, if spoken publicly yet with nothing to trigger the brainwashed. If enough women read this without anything to set off their Pavlov conditioning, I'm sure they'd swell with pride enough to spread the idea. Women love to talk. The problem they're facing, as I've noticed, is that this half-assed dream of feminism is strangling them. The conditions they're subjected to are not under providers or defenders. They work long hours, leaving their children at home to be programmed by the idiot box and in schools of pure propaganda. Men rarely bring home the bacon entirely anymore. Women are forced into this equality narrative that completely disregards their biological needs. To become mothers, to actually raise their children and feel supported (I'm not talking emotionally) by their husbands. My profession is social. I've spoken to a few about this situation. They're not happy, and it's easy to understand why. This society has been degraded by jewish intervention, as have previous empires they've subverted.</div>

<br>idk what the other parts were about so I trust the stated reservations on accuracy, effectiveness, and quality. However, the few strings on humanity, where maybe Anon loosely described a process of degeneration as applied throughout humanity now, followed by the rise of man, is what I am looking for.

<br>I just go straight for "jews did 9/11".
<br>Works every time.
<br>And for people who ask "how do you feel about rayciss trump ?!?". I tell them trump is a jew and surrounds himself with jews. People eat that stuff right up.
<br>Same with "puuuuuuuuritans !!!". I share the origin, Purim, and then the anti-religious energy is redirected from the American settler to the stinky jew.
<br>
<br>I do have trouble with gas chambers, though. People want to believe Germans did such a retarded thing, even after pointing out the lice and typhus and the doors and the japanese and german "death" camps made by "allies lol" and the numbers and the fake pictures on the jewsenthal site and all the other "jews are bad" arguments that they agree with. And most people are too npc to be moved along a line of logic using the socratic method of asking questions that they answer themselves. Life is easy but unwashing the masses is hard.</div>

I aim these at anons but your quite right with the idea of forming them for more open consumption, striking a balance between board culture and the core of a message can be a tricky beast to tame. You also raise a good point on the images, in truth I... I actually do not know why I changed them. I wanted to reflect the values spoken of with a man who embodied them in his actions but as you point out the public perception of reality is warped beyond sane comprehension. I have considered formulating a PDF of a more "user friendly" version replacing the use of the harsher words while retaining a clear indicator of the parasites alterations to our culture and it's use of their golems but there is still a vast amount of /sig/ concepts that need to be covered before I undertake that project.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#72492">&gt;&gt;72492</a><br>You are correct in a manner but you cannot see the wheat through the chaff.

However we do not need to win them all, we merely need to forge a path for those with the Will to stand, to show them there is a path through the dark. Each of us marches on, coming to the truth in a myriad of ways, moments of clarity bestowed by both experience and knowledge. The goal must be twofold, to show the parasites machinations and to demonstrate it can be broken, that is the purpose we must have.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#72500">&gt;&gt;72500</a><br>That "feel" of the rise of Man as you put it, while it may seem to be extinguished is in fact still ever present within you. It is subdued and understandably so, the situation seeming ever dire as the parasite continues it's unending gorging of money and blood. However, despite the grasp of the semetic manipulators being vast, it is also quite tenuous. It seeks control, more so than it currently has and grows more rabid with each passing day. One must remember however a man tortured and brutalised day after day will only endure so much. They wish us fattened and weak, the carrot of unending consumption and demoralising media combined with the stick of tearing out the tongues of Men who speak against them, these tools are slowly being eroded as the civilisation they infested begins to buckle, the fetid corruption making it brittle and unwieldy. There always comes a point where a Man will rise, take the stick from the parasites hand, break it over his knee and beat his opponent with the remains. People are noticing the cracks slowly, at least in my view, causing one of two reactions; a pursuit for truth or a pursuit for comfort, said comfort being self destructive and a mere illusion. We few here, we understand our history, our people and our nature. We steel ourselves because we have to lest the shadow consume us, the yearning for a rise from the ashes dim but ever present. However a true rise cannot occur until the stick is taken from the parasite, it will try and distract with changing the carrot from time to time but they will not change from their goal thus nor shall we. <br><br>I would also point you to our people as a sign that a rise is not merely needed but inevitable by both our words and actions. Look upon what they have become, satiating themselves, numbing themselves to escape the horrifying miasma that has been created. The young crying out for a future, for a dream that was promised them by their grand parents only to be betrayed and lost to nihilism and darkness. Every blade ran across a vein in a moment of misery, every soul ending their own suffering in drugs and degeneracy, every vice that they use to numb the pain, it is a cry for help, a cry for a future they have been denied, the despair and sorrow unending. It falls to *us* to give them back that future. It is a burden to bear, a weight that tests the Will of every Man that carries it but it is a burden we carry none the less for no one else can. We must be the ones to clear the path for the Rise of our people, to give what has been denied by leading by example and inspiring them to something greater. When it all collapses, and rest assured it will for no amount of propping up can maintain it, it must be us who raises our banners among the ruins, who lights the path beyond leading our people from the death and degeneration surrounding us in the gloaming twilight of this era. Each step, each word spoken in resistance to this grim world, is a step towards us rising. *We* are the speartip of that rising, take heart in your brothers and find faith in your blood.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#73007">&gt;&gt;73007</a><br>I've met such replies before on occasion, it troubles me not. If one wishes to live in stagnation without understanding he is allowing himself to be a mere puppet I usually lack sympathy. It is their own future they forfeit. Even if it is just a handful of men who take heed then it is more than I achieved before I broached each topic.<br><br>Now for a topic of great importance; Understanding the Battle.<br><br>Often, in my posts I speak of solidarity between those with the wisdom to see how dire our situation is. The parasite is cunning in it's ways, engineering events at an accelerated rate, it's push for degeneration and subjugation ever increasing. An observant man may note however, the poison of degeneracy, nihilism and hedonism seem to repeat throughout European history. Men of bravery and valour find themselves sublimated by the weak and the duplicitous for men grow old and when they do their wisdom is not always heeded by the inheritors for sometimes an outsider comes offering shiny baubles in the stead of wisdom and dignity. I could cite the now overly remarked upon Rome as an example of this (and a fine example it is) or one the countless stories of fallen empires however I will not belabor the point; the system as it stands now cannot be changed, only slowed. It has grown fat and cumbersome, the founding principals of all our nations forgotten. Not merely that but it has been corrupted to the point of being inimically hostile to it's own founding populations, each "democratic" systems supposed positives morphed into a vile mockery of it's previous form. Thusly the battle we face isn't just for the immediate but for the after as well. <br><br>I've often heard an accelerationist say "yeah I agree so let's crash it" but such thinking is often lacking nuance. Let us say for instance, using a common piece of "fear porn", an EMP is discharged that immediately disables all electronics in a country. Now, despite the modern semetic concept of "it'll be chaos, rapes, murders, warlords, goyim it'll be horrible!" I would posit it would be more confusion for our people specifically. Undoubtedly the "diverse" population would, as is seen not merely in crime statistics within our own countries but within the nations they come from, rather rabid. But we sons of Europe? It would be confusion. With the suppression of community and family the lack of unity would illicit not a short sighted goal of "grab all you can grab, fuck dat bitch and load the gat" (or machete if within Europe) but rather questioning of what to do. It would be that confusion in the fog of ethnic chaos that would cause incredibly severe losses to our populations. It would grant the parasite it's goal with only some pockets of our people surviving if at all if things accelerated in such a manner. The battle for today is not merely to unite under a single goal of European survival but to forge the Men needed to do just that, and such a forging takes time. Time we already do not have. This battle, this war, it cannot end until one group or the other is expelled from the lands, ideally peacefully but the parasites machinations of inciting hate against Europeans is lowering that margin considerably.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">The trite idea of coexistence is a pleasant, perhaps even hopeful concept, however reality is far from it. Yes some peoples can find joint causes with cultures of a similar vein (the Japanese concepts of honour, while partially alien, make an interesting cousin to traditional European honour) but to mingle populations is impossible as despite the cult of "modern science" ignoring all medical, sociological and cultural difference, the claim we are all one people is laughable and built upon a lie that ignores two centuries of scientific study on it. Simply put we are not "one race" and nor should we be for we are observing the results of such a sadistic concept in practise. Not merely this but when one group is deployed as a golem to not merely harass but to crush another, it is inevitable that at some point the targeted population will cease to be, either through bloodshed or self destruction. There is a reason the concept of the "well integrated" stranger is sold so often, it is to hide the bloodied shells our cities have become at the hands of the rest of the "based" strangers people. Our children violated, lives destroyed for the sin of being White in their own nations and the betrayal of our governments who hid the truth for the parasite. The rape of our very soil for those who claim it with nought a word of resistance being offered by those who should of stood against. Entire swathes of our homeland merely set aside for those who seek to offer only misery in return while still daring to ask for more. Meanwhile our future? Distilled only to consume and ask no questions and seek nothing further for it no longer belongs to you. <br><br>I cannot lie to any of you reading this. Our situation is indeed most dire. It is an end of this epoch, the dying gasps of a body no longer able to hold on as poisons riddle it's veins. But we can and must slow down the rot as long as possible to ensure as many Men of Action are forged within the time we can amass. The darkness we face now will pale in comparison to the shadows that are forming just beyond our sight. The parasite knows what is coming otherwise it would not attack as openly as it does now, it seeks acceleration so it can have the excuse of forming new ways to suppress us before we are ready. We must slow the parasite as our immediate goal and forge ourselves and those like us into the Men we need to be. Though we are scattered individuals there is something that binds us as brothers. We have come to believe in ourselves as Men, we have come to believe in ourselves as Europeans. It is in our blood to face such darkness and never flinch, never falter. We know we must survive not merely to fix this sad state of affairs but to let it crumble so we can build anew, build something worthy of ourselves, of our people. All the things arrayed against us and yet we still live, we still resist the torment and the misery. We resist it because we can, because someone needs to bring light not to just today but to tomorrow. That is who we are and there is no one more worthy of such a battle.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#73646">&gt;&gt;73646</a><br>Unrest. You have been in a prolonged period of alertness for potential threats and the concept of separating your mind for a brief measure of respite automatically triggers a fight or flight mechanism. It does necessarily need to be an immediate threat also, merely something impending is enough to cloud the mind. Even in a conflict as gargantuan as what we face a man must find respite, I would mayhaps suggest taking a brief period for yourself. If I find myself troubled deeply I will sometimes merely take a walk alone for a few hours somewhere isolated or listen to Clair De Lune (or an alternative you enjoy) with no distractions such as a computer or tablet, letting yourself float for a brief moment upon an ocean of serenity. It should help alleviate troubles, if only for a time.<br><br>As an aside i'm hoping to have a special gift for you fine gentlemen in the future, I've ordered a scanner for recording some of my older books concerning /sig/ related topics, namely physical fitness, cooking (although their not exactly "keto" as that seems to be the in thing, they are most assuredly enjoyable to cook and hearty dishes for men on the path to improving) and an assortment of pieces concerning European traditions from Hammertons Manners and Customs of Mankind (cover included as image for those curious) in an effort to offer grounding for any and all far flung sons and daughters of Europa. It will likely take a while to get the time to scan the books so do not expect anything fast though i'm afraid.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">So, i've done a good portion concerning mindset, rather than focus on that tonight let us talk practicals. The first step is always the hardest so let us start simple and build up to the more advanced aspects.<br><br>Firstly, I would ask any of you considering /sig/ but feeling daunted by the myriad of tasks to simply look around you in your room right now. What is it that surrounds you? For most (but of course not all) it will be plain walls maybe adorned by some generic Argos or Walmart art or even a movie poster, maybe a few objet' dart concerning some TV series or movie, perhaps even an action figure of some sort, maybe a few books of no real note and furniture-wise all generic, straight out of the catalogue items. You are, in essense, a mere cog, a mere speck upon the current tapestry of life in this dire era. All around you has no personality, no soul, no character, it is all mass produced tedium. You yourself are hardly to blame for this, it is all you know after all, bland hollow things to fill a space. It doesn't feel like a home does it? Not truly. This is where your journey to growing begins, breaking the confines of this mediocre cell and all it requires is the simplest of steps.<br><br>What are the integral things to the European spirit beyond truth, honour and dignity? Nature. Nature is a key component missing from many a life. It is abundant and simple yet so often forgotten about. So this is where to start. Bring some life into your home in the form of plants. It need not be some prissy thing requiring specific watering days and unique minerals mixed in, it can be simple. Simple as say a Spider Plant. Low maintenance, can grow to a decent size and it happens to be good for air quality, something especially useful if living in a city or a smoker. Cheap too! Want a touch more colour but still something fairly straight forward? Consider an Orchid, they can be fairly pleasant and spruce a corner of a dull desk or table up in a pinch. Aloe Vera plants are also fairly pleasant if a touch bland, they also hold some useful application if used right which is something to bear in mind. Having some nature in your living space can do wonders for morale and is a cheap and efficient way of doing it. It's a simple first step is it not? So what are you waiting for, have a shop around, online or a local garden store, it's such a simple thing.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Now, let us say you completed this small task, what next? You feel partially motivated but what else can be done that's easy to keep the momentum going? Beauty. Beauty is what is missing. But mayhaps one asks, where can I put something beautiful? Walls of course. Take down that tacky movie poster, dispose of that generic mass produced picture of a sunset and seek something beautiful. But what do I mean by that, are sunsets not beautiful? They can be but they hardly represent true beauty or greatness in picture form when one has a window to look out of to see the real thing, it is a poor and very semetic simulacrum of what you already possess. You can often find framed art cheap in a variety of places be it in print or real replicas. Charity shops can sometimes yield something beautiful if you shop around and often at ridiculously low prices (at least in the UK they can, British Heart Foundation etc are places you can locate some art fairly cheaply at, I should think there is an analogue in the US for such shops). But let us say you have no shops like that close, then consider looking up specific framed prints on Ebay (yes I know it's a giant flea market but it is a useful avenue in this regard). As an example i've included a picture with this post demonstrating a piece I ordered via Ebay of the Battle of Rorkes Drift, a snapshot of heroism in the face of horrifying odds. This is but one avenue for you to consider however, there are so many beautiful moments of European history, heroism and culture captured in art (I find the Romantic style most appealing personally), it is these things that inspire that should ordain your walls, not the vacuous things reminding you of how hollow this age has become. What has a deeper meaning, Robert Downy Jnr wearing a tin suit pretending to be a hero or the Birth of Venus by Botticelli? Which one has a more intrinsic link to your being, to your blood? A gimp in a silly suit or a reminder of the beauty made specifically for you to inherit as part of your birthright?<br><br>These are but two examples, there are so many more. Looking for proper furniture can be good, I know it sounds trite but for instance if you need a desk rather than Ikea, for the same money and with patience you can find a beautiful oak desk in antique shops etc, something solid and grand rather than the tedious toughened glass desk or the cheap chipboard rubbish so often sold. The key is to rise, rise above the mire and embrace things that are beautiful by nature, not the things that your told to like by (((media))) and the mass produced garbage of this age.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">These are physical aspects however, what of the mental. One can create beauty in their living space but it means nothing if the mind is still made ill. To this end, I keep it simple as possible; if you watch TV, just turn it off. Skip the soy filled comic movies, abandon the degenerate "buddy" comedies where retards get into trouble by being retards, it's all a demonstration on how to live a ruined life anyway, what do you lose. The semetic power fantasy of magically being given power, not earning it or the entertainment of some fools trying to mount some prostitutes and getting drunk on a road trip? The entirety of modern mainstream media, in case you had somehow missed it, is designed to destroy your will and spirit. It's just as bad as the modern news cycle which most avoid, it's selling you self destructive ideas just in a subtler form. Same applies to online, it's all well and good watching some Lets Play or some idiot discuss his favourite character in a game or something, it's also incredibly hollow. It's a reflection of what you're trying to break free from thusly by consuming such media you become trapped in the cycle. Break that cycle. Even if you think you know the games being played and wish to watch it with a critical eye, it's still entrapment, those ideas are still being pushed on you even with the cognition to recognise it. It will still sap your spirit, mayhaps even more so as you know what it's goal is.<br><br>Now the big push for most, you have identified the areas in your immediate space and life and required change and began working upon it but something hangs over you. Take your shirt off and go look in a mirror. What do you see? Do you a see a paunch middle aged man with a protruding gut, mayhaps a late teens gangly form lacking definition and shape, maybe something in between both examples. Most men come to /sig/ wishing to reform this without ever understanding the underlying psychology behind how to become permanently stronger. Most will get physically fitter for a brief spell until they get out of the habit and slip back, their Will sapped. This is why I have spoken so strongly on the understanding of what it takes to define your form for if the body is to be reformed then the spirit and mind supporting it must be built to withstand the dedication it requires. Only with the strength of the spirit and unbending Will can lead you to a point where you feel truly content in yourself. I won't go on too long about these ideas, I would direct you to these if you seek understanding;<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#71158">&gt;&gt;71158</a><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#71159">&gt;&gt;71159</a><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#71160">&gt;&gt;71160</a> (and <a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#71164">&gt;&gt;71164</a> <a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#71165">&gt;&gt;71165</a> for supplementary)<br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#71892">&gt;&gt;71892</a><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#71893">&gt;&gt;71893</a><br><br>So where to start? First, you must bite a bullet and find a local gym. Now there is an addendum to this and that is find one with minimal diversity, even if it means going further afield than your comfortable with. The reason beyond the obvious is quite simple, in a gym environment some feel more at risk or fear of judgement than usual, having the risks of diversity nearby will only make the experience unassailable. Don't consider this an excuse though, you *must* find a gym if you want to stand the best chance at dedication due to the variety of equipment offered, don't fall for the picking up cinder blocks in the back garden crap you'll sometimes see on /fit/, no one ever does that beyond those already deep into /fit/. Identified a gym? Good. Now force yourself to sign up, don't stall and say you'll do it later, just get it done and out the way then go buy cotton shorts and a light t-shirt, none of the plastic sportswear of the ridiculous underarmour unless your now pretending to be an athlete. Also make sure not to get those useless extras gyms offer such as free juice or personal trainers and so forth, you can research technique and routines online easily.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Start with simple things, don't go doing full out training regimes and pace yourself. I say force regarding signing up as let us be honest, while we each claim we will just buy weights and do it at home or jog around the block, these things can often be pipe dreams, you *need* to be tied into it in order to have the push to do it. Yes, gyms are annoying at times. It can be busy, the music and TV's always blare out degeneracy and shrieking music videos of negros lusting after white blonde women, it is designed that way very deliberately in this modern age. It has become an environment for the empty headed 'chads and stacies' as their known, a shrine for the vanity of the modern man or woman and designed to make them idolise both themselves and the outsider. You are entering the belly of the beast in that regard but the reward for such a thing is great. Pride. Achievement. Victory. These are the things you can attain. It is a test of your resolve and your success or failure rests squarely upon your own shoulders. There are ways to alleviate the negative aspects however. A brother to go with is always a welcome companion on the path but if you do walk alone simply headphones and appropriate music will do, it separates you from the degeneracy and allows greater focus. Also never allow self judgement to stop you, it does not matter how small and skinny your frame nor how corpulent and obese you are as long as you understand that your body is transitory, you are going there to fix it, to reshape it bit by bit. Yes there are muscled pseudo men of questionable sexuality and sometimes women of fair beauty but they care not for you or your form, they only care for their own empty lives and having a hole to fill or be filled by some whore of the male or female variety. You are better than them by your very nature and your challenge is greater than they shall ever know. You are there to conquer it, to face a battle with yourself, it is in such conflicts we build ourselves anew. You merely just need to drop the shackles the semite has placed upon your spirit and face it. <br><br>As I stated in <a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#71162">&gt;&gt;71162</a> it is the first few weeks that are the killer, they are the hump to it. After climbing that though there are minor bumps along the way such as holidays etc, sometimes the motivation to return to the routine can be tricky, the comfort has made you soft. The key is remembering your purpose, your cause. It is to attain greatness, to build the form fitting for your spirit and mind. Even if it means walking through the pouring rain or snow on a day when you feel despondent, it is merely another aspect for you to push through, to conquer. Each step is a step forward, always remember that. You fight for your future in becoming a better man in all the aspects I have listed thus far, embrace it.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">This is for all of you on the path to /sig/ but are struggling or have struggled in the past. It's a lonely path we walk isn't it? The weight of the world can feel crushing at time, the loneliness, the despair, it hangs heavy upon you. We feel alone and abandoned. Boards slowly get subverted or outright removed, our tongues lashed as we watch those we fight for and live for fall by the way side. It hurts. We all feel it. But no son of Europa has to bear this burden alone. We persist not because it's all we know, not because we are merely waiting to die as time moves ever forwards but because it is our nature to survive, nay thrive. But in this miserable time thriving is no longer an option open so we survive, hoping one day something will arise, something will awaken. That faith will be restored to us, in our brothers, our sons and our people at large. To this end I write what I write not because of a need for recognition in my words or a need for fame for no one will likely ever know my name and nor should they. My words are not even mine in truth but our own, the things we have all forgotten in this time of shadows. I write these things because I love my people, I love each and every brother who makes their own stand among these ruins for they are the men who I will always believe in. It is *you* reading this who I believe in. I count each man who walks with us as the last defenders of Europa and will always find pride in knowing out there, among the chaos of this time, are men who I have helped find their way in the same vein as others who helped me. So don't ever feel alone in this. None of us are alone for we carry the fire of Europa in our hearts and the Will to fight in our spirits. We'll make it together.</div>

This means getting enough quality food and enough sleep. You can only train as hard as you can recover from. Get a minimum of 7 hours of sleep, keep your alcohol consumption to the absolute minimum as this inhibits muscle protein synthesis, eat at least 1.5g protein x bodyweight in pounds, consume 8g total of iodized sodium throughout the day, spread your food out through at least 5 meals a day which will allow you to have a constant supply of aminos in your blood stream. I also would recommend takin an intra-workout supplement (anything with Essential Amnios and a fast acting carb source like Branch Cyclic Dextrin). This will allow you to get nutrients to the muscle while you are training and promote faster recovery and less muscle soreness. You don't want to train on an empty stomach as you will have 'empty blood'. We want blood that is full of nutrients, especially when training. <br><br><br>The Split <br><br>This split is rotational and allows you to train each body part 2 times within a 7 day period and gives two days of recovery in each 7 day period. Even if you feel ok to train again it is still important to use the recovery days as assigned. If you feel beat up it is ok and even encouraged to take an extra day off.. <br>The sequence is <br><br>Split Layout <br><br>Shoulders / Triceps / Traps (can be put on back day instead)<br>Back / Abs<br>off <br>Chest / Biceps <br>Legs / Calves <br>off<br>Repeat <br><br>I would also recommend at least 15-20 minutes of cardio each day. You will need to have a minimum level of condition to even be able to complete these workouts especially when it gets into drop sets, extended sets, etc.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">2<br><br><br>Exercise Selection and Sequence <br><br>There are 4 phases of training that we are going to use. They are Activation, Maximum Force, Super Pump, and Loaded Stretch and they work in that order. Personally, I think activation is more useful for body parts you have a hard time 'feeling'. So, if you can't feel your lats it's good to do an isolation exercises with lighter weight higher reps to build the mind muscle connection before getting into a moderate rep range with heavier weights to generate maximum force.<br><br>Sample workouts <br><br>Shoulders / Triceps <br><br>1. Shoulder Press. Goal = train explosively. Do a few warm up sets and then get into your working sets. Do 3 sets with ascending weight. Example, 135x6, 145x6, 155x6. The last rep of the last set should be hard to the point you probably couldn‚Äôt do another.<br><br>2. Over-and-backs. Super Pump / Time under tension. Simply take a barbell in the front rack postion and lift it over your head from the front position to the back position. This is one rep. Do 8-12 reps working up in weight with each set. 3-4 sets. <br><br>3. Lateral delt raises. Goal = Super Pump. Do standard lateral raises here. Like always we are going to be working up in ascending weight. I like these in the 12-15 rep range. Make sure you‚Äôre keeping tension on the delts and not the traps which can happen if you go up too high or aren‚Äôt controlling the weight. Feel free to throw a drop set in here too.<br><br>4. Partial Dumb bell lateral raises. Goal = overload / Super Pump. Simply grab a dumb bell that‚Äôs maybe 20 pounds or so heavier than what you were doing your lateral raises with and do partial reps with it. You‚Äôre probably going to want to use straps for this. Do 3-4 sets in the ~20 rep range. As you get tired your range of motion will decrease just keep swinging but maintain control, don‚Äôt stick your neck out and tweak it. <br><br>5. Close Grip Bench Press, Machine Dip, JM Press, take your pick here. We want a lift that‚Äôs a bit heavier here and go for a moderate 6-8 rep range training the triceps explosively. <br><br>6. Close grip cable attachement tricep pushdown. We are going to target the lateral head here. Do reps in the 12-15 range and really keep tension on the triceps getting them full of blood. <br><br>7. Behind the head tricep extension. Now that the muscle is loaded with blood we are going to stretch it out. Take your pick here, could be a standing or bent rope extension on a cable machine, a behind the head extension machine, or seated dumbbell extensions. Lots of options here. Make sure you‚Äôre going nice and controlled and on the last rep of each set hold the stretch positon for ten seconds. <br><br>8. Rear delts. You can use a reverse pec deck or bent over dumb bell swings with a palms facing down grip (neutral grip is ok but not as effective). I want 3-4 sets of 20-25 reps here. If you are using a machine then hold the last rep in the contracted position for 10 seconds on the last rep of each set. These get tough, just keep swinging away. Range of Motion is less important here as the set continues.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">3<br><br><br>Back / Abs<br><br>1. single arm cable row. goal = activation of the lats. 3x10-12 with ascending weight. use  a. good squeeze in the contracted position. Leave about 3 reps in the tank here.<br><br>2. single arm row variation. There are so many different row variations, find one you like. Some of the ones I use are Meadows Rows, 1-arm barbell rows (done on the t-bar), dead stop dumb bell rows, and Hammer Strength Iso Low Row. Remember to always pull with the elbows and not the hands/wrist. Work your way up to a hard set of 6-8 reps here hitting failure on that last rep. Example, 30x8, 50x8, 60x8, 70x7. Goal = maximum force<br><br>3. Dorian Deadlift (3.4ths deadlift). You can either do this from the floor or in a rack. Once you've got the bar in a locked-out position like you would in a deadlift lower it to about an inch or 2 below the knee, or to mid shin, now explode the weight upwards. Do not hyper-extend your back when you lock out, do not go past a neutral spine. Work up to a top set of 6-8 and then take a plate off each side and shoot for another 10-15 reps. Stop 1 rep short of failure, you don't want to get hurt. <br>Example, 135x10, 225x10, 315x8, 365x8, 405x6, 315x15<br><br>4. Chest supported row. Use a slightly wider than shoulder width grip here. The goal is to hit your rhomboids, mid back, and some rear delts. Keep your chest planted on the pad and give 10-12 reps squeezing hard. On the end of each set let the weight pull you forward stretching out your back and hold it for 10 seconds. Goal = Pump and stretch<br><br>5. Horizontal pulldown. This could be a lat pulldown or a machine that is similar to it. Keep a slight arch in your back and drive your elbows into your back pockets. Get a good contraction here. do 3 sets of 10-12 here getting the lats nice and pumped. <br><br>6. Pullover. If you have a pullover machine use this, Nautilus and Hammer Strength both have one but they are rare. If not the second best option is a banded pullover. If you don't have bands, you should get some at some point but for now just use a regular dumb bell pullover. Bring the weight only to your forehead if you don't have a band on it. Don't worry about the stretch depth the first couple sets / reps, they will get progressively deeper as you get loosened up. Goal = train the muscle from a stretched position. <br><br>7. Abs, 3-4 sets to failure. I use either an ab wheel or do roman chain leg raises. Do something that doesn't stress your lower back. <br><br>Off Day.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">4<br><br>Chest / Biceps <br><br>1. Incline Barbell Press. Work you way up to a top set of 6-8 reps here going to failure. Use a spotter and if you can get a couple extra forced reps that's great too. Remember to lower with control, and explode up, think about lifting fast and generating as much force as possible even if the bar doesn't move fast. Bring the bar a couple inches above your chest as to save your shoulders. Goal = maximum force<br><br>2. Machine bench press. I like using machines because they allow one to go to failure in a safer way, especially if they don't have a training partner. Use whatever machine gives you a strong contraction and best mind muscle connection without hurting. 3x10-12 here<br><br>3. Decline variation. Personally, I use a hammer strength decline bench but a dumb bell on a slight decline is good too. This will allow you train that outer and under portion of the pec, try to feel a good stretch here. <br><br>4. Incline pronated grip (palms facing away) dumb bell chest fly or a regular pec deck. <br>If you choose to use a dumb bell fly do not lock the reps out as this will take tension off the pec. If you are using a machine fly, feel free to lock out and squeeze the contraction. Add in some partial reps on the bottom portion of the exercise too if you'd like.<br><br>5. Hammer Curls. Work up to a top set of 10 reps here. This trains the Bicep Brachialis which is the muscle on the side of your arm and will give the arm a more full and thicker look. <br><br>6. Curl variation of your choice excluding preacher curl or variations. Make sure you are keeping tension on the biceps and not cheating too bad by using shoulders and back to swing it. There are some advanced techniques that call for this but you aren't there... yet. Generate maximum force, squeeze the contraction, and lower with control. Flex the bicep the entire time and squeeze the shit out of the barbell / dumb bell / whatever. <br><br>7. Preacher curl, or incline dumb bell curl (about 15-20 degrees incline) Nice and slow lowering, keep palms facing up the whole time, get a good contraction and let your biceps stretch out. 3 sets of 10-12</div>

  <div class="divMessage">5<br><br>Legs<br><br>1. Single Leg Hamstring Curl or Seated Hamstring Curl. Do a few sets of 15 here superseded with your Squat variation of choice in exercise 2.  <br><br>2. Squat variation. Personally I like to use ether a power squat machine or hack squat. If you use a hack squat keep your feet at the bottom of the platform, closer is better but being at the bottom is more important than width. Work up to a top set of 6 reps. Get some rest, take the weight down to something you could do for about 12-15 reps and get 20 with it. <br><br>3. Leg Press, you only need 1 or 2 warm up sets here, work up to a weight you can barely get 15 with. Do your set, rack the weight and rest 30 seconds, do as many reps as you can in one go and then rack the weight again and rest another 30 seconds, unrack and go again. As an example 15, 9, 5. This is called a cluster set.<br><br>4. Leg extensions. 3 sets of 30 reps with a 30 second stretch on each quad after each set<br><br>5. Lying Hamstring Curl. Work up to a good weight and do 3 sets of 10 with it. On the 4th set do a drop set with 2 drops. Example work up to 100 on weight stack. 2-3 sets with it of 10 reps. 3rd or 4th set (last set) 100x8, 70x10, 50x10 <br><br>6. Stiff Legged Deadlifts. Barbell or Dumb bell, work up to a top set of 10 reps. Go down nice and controlled. Think about pushing your butt back to lower yourself rather than putting your chest down. <br><br>7. Calve machine of choice, keep weight on big toe / ball of foot. Do not roll foot outwards. Hold each rep in the stretch position for at least 5 seconds. Get a total of 100 reps in any fashion.<br><br><br>Off<br><br>Repeat <br><br>Add deload weeks as needed, usually every 5-6 weeks. During a deload week try to use about 80% volume. No drop sets, don't go to failure, don't use bands. <br>This is just a sample, Adjust as needed. Add variation as needed. Try to add weight / reps each week. When that stops working you can start adding in more intensity techniques like drop sets, cluster sets, forced reps and accommodating resistance like bands and chains.Your training should be hard but not so hard you get hurt and not so hard you can't recover from it. Again, adjust as needed. Train hard but train smart. Take additional off days as needed, drop volume or increase volume as needed. Nothing is set in stone. If you feel like another rep / set / whatever is going to lead to injury just don't do it and live to fight another day. That one rep isn't going to make you huge but it can fuck you up for a very long time.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Upon the topic of conditioning; reforging ones self against the corrosive self flagellation.<br><br>With the mere mention of conditioning no doubt many a reader will have the image of the rotund yet oddly still muscled form of Alex Jones ripping off his shirt in a fit of inarticulate scripted rage. To a degree he does have an understanding of what conditioning is but fails to see the degenerative seeds from which it has grown. When I refer to conditioning I do not speak of the push for "accept the mentally ill's justification of self mutilation" nor the "race mixing is great goy" for both can be easily dispelled with a mere glance at scientific data by the common man, rates of crime or mental illness or research into these subjects showing clearly the lie (even if the semetic powers are attempting to suppress such information it is still fairly well documented). No, what I refer to is our hijacked sense of altruism. In the European Man's very building blocks is the gift of altruism, it is a key component that helped lead to the formation of healthcare, public works and areas of great beauty such as monuments and public parks, the creators of these monuments leaving something for the generations that will follow after akin to the ancient Greek proverb of planting trees you yourself will never see. It is a key component to our ability to empathise, a more unique trait to our kin, one clearly lacking in the semetic, negroid and arab offshoots. One could even argue it is a part of our very 'soul'. It has also unfortunately become a tool for the semites to utilise our own downfall, it becoming warped into acceptance of all that is corrupt for "you should be tolerant, don't you empathise with your 'fellow man'" and "doesn't this stranger deserve the things you have, have you forgotten your blood libel, sorry, sins of colonialism" have become the standards of this corrupted form of altruism. The fool argues for these things, the soul darkened by hatred will argue that we should completely dispel the thoughts of altruism, I however would argue for a third position. That of reinvigorating it within our own people. I do not necessarily suggest you build monuments nor parks you will never see but a much more simpler approach. Support your own kin in the simplest form and offer nothing outside of it.<br><br>Let me offer the simplest of examples. Let us say you are getting a taxi. The driver that arrives is of arab persuasion. It is common place, at least within these grim shores of Albion, to offer a small tip at the end of the journey. Simply do not offer a tip. Now let us reframe, the driver in this case is a fellow countrymen or even just a general European. In this event, you do offer a tip. It sounds ludicrously simple does it not. You favour your kin and withhold favour to the outsider. I know this will seem obvious to some but for others, this is a point that they never quite realised they could do for they merely accepted it as common courtesy. This is an example of the inbuilt altruism, it has granulated so much that even a thing such as this is an act of rebellion, ponder that for a moment. We have become so used to this social interaction many rarely question it. It is one thing to offer jobs to brothers quietly or show support for White European identity in her homelands and her colonies but it is another to practise it in all it's forms. The same thing can be expanded to not just this minor interaction but to restaurants (although if you do indeed visit a restaurant ran by a non white it may be prudent to always check health certifications beforehand if it cannot be avoided). Only tip your waiter if they are a fellow countrymen, even if they are a degenerate with pink hair for despite the malady gripping at that moment they are still kin and mayhaps one day, when the dam breaks, remember your kindness.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Let us look a bit more macro rather than these single incidents of social politeness however, let us expand a little further. For the sake of the board being mostly brothers from America I will use an example I believe most of you will be familiar with; convenience stores. It is a common trope that most 7/11s within America (known as corner shops in the UK and most European nations, they also fall into this trope) of being ran by non whites, mostly Indians or Arabs. They are usually not far away, easily accessible and offer basic amenities. They are, as the name suggests, convenient. This offers two serious issues however. Firstly, you are supporting the business of someone who has no right being there, some may make feeble arguments saying "well their not all bad" etc but make no mistake, they know and you know the very soil they stand on is not theirs nor should it be. The second is the weakening effect of convenience. It has made us soft, this easy access. One seeking supplies need only walk five to ten minutes to foreign owned shop, buy a subpar item of poor quality then waddle home giddy at his sweet treats and chemical slurry known as an energy drink. This is the pathetic state of modern man, one that should be countered and can be with the most simplest of mindsets; find an independent business owned by a brother and frequent there. Failing to do so due to diversity, simply find a chain ran by a brother European and be picky about what you buy. You tackle two birds with one stone as the adage goes. Firstly, you withhold support for the stranger and if a White European owned business offer support to it and secondly you help shake off the weakening effect of convenience, even if only mildly. <br><br>Indulge me if you will on sharing a fundamental reasoning for this which can be observed by any man who has visited a heavily "diverse" city or location. I was taught from a young age the importance of manners and good form, that is to say pre emptively open a door for a lady politely if you see them coming, hold open the door if there is someone coming through after you generally, address people politely and with respect, never beginning a meal before the host has been seated and so forth. I am no highborn, quite the opposite but I was a keen learner as a child and was taught well. Now when visiting smaller towns with mostly White European populations such manners are met with reciprocation, the elderly lady will thank you and perhaps comment how there aren't many people like you left or the gentlemen behind you will say "cheers pal" as he follows through and shop keepers and pub landlords will always be warm in their dealings with you. As an aside I have always found they at first would be puzzled due to my stature and demeanor but after realising I am not a threat to them they always seem to warm up. Now such a thing is not a uniquely British trait despite our proclivity for being anal in our social interactions, it has always been a common courtesy for most Europeans. If one were to watch 1950's American TV one would witness such things as standard, the social contract between kin being one of reasonable respect, the same goes for every European nation and culture prior to the semetic subversion of our media. Now, if one were to do this in a diversified location and observe if it is returned, well, one finds the nature of the beast is truly revealed. The negro will flounce through nary a word of thanks, the third worlder will ignore your courtesy and remain haughty and vile, simply put despite the concept of the "integrated" individuals among them, by and large these groups simply do not see value in such things and prefer to live as close to barely above bestial as possible akin to their homelands.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">They do not think like we do, their natures diametrically opposed to what one could term the European standard. It is with this in mind thusly we should withhold our courtesies to these groups, they deserve not our method of society for they can never grasp it, at best they can form a degenerated simulacrum of it which perpetually falls apart when among their own. Reserve your respect and kindness for your own only, even at personal cost, for if we are true to our words of having faith in our people we must treat them akin to how we wish to be treated. We must escape the trap of treating the invader and the stranger as kin while deftly jumping over the nihilistic pit of in turn becoming like them that so many of our brethren have fallen in to.<br><br>While on this subject allow me to counter a common argument against this which is "hurrr well look at our people, they take drugs, watch soy shit and fuck niggers so their just as bad as the migrants". Yes, I will not deny you speak truth in that statement. I will not say treat our worst as brothers for despite being kin some have fallen too far from the state of the European Man to be recovered but I will say some among them may one day be salvaged. It is only due to the fact they *are* kin that I even hold that concept of redemption for the sad few who surrendered, mayhaps it's a weakness of my own I have yet to purge or perhaps I see a part of my old self in their self inflicted suffering. An ignorance to a better way, attempts to fill an empty spirit with the poisons that will only cause more misery. I cannot abandon them all and nor should you. The simple act of treating those wounded as a brother can sometimes give them a life raft to cling on too, never forget that.<br><br>So to summarise; exclude those not of your own kin from your altruism and embrace your people for they are *your* people. Withhold the spirit of European kindness from the stranger whenever you can for even this simple act can send a mighty message, one of defiance in the face of societal collapse. Uphold the greatness of your nature and never allow it to become denigrated for the sake of nihilism or hatred. It is this that made the semite and it's compatriots so afraid of our nature, the nobility of ourselves and these values. They sought to corrupt it, to make it as grey and vile as themselves. We must seek to repair it and embrace it in it's true form once more. If we were to lose this piece of ourselves, if we were to cut away this part of our nature then we would lose one of the most important aspects to ourselves and such a sacrifice must never be given, must never be offered lest we become the very things we are fighting against. No more hesitancy, no more cowardice. This was our way long before the parasite and shall be long after it is removed from our domain.</div>

<br>
<br>Many often try and pass off the effects of the subversion citing men who come to find the truth as examples that breaking the hold can be done by any but what they often fail to understand is the sheer struggle many a man has to endure as he comes to terms with the realisation of how dire the situation is, either buckling to nihilism or suffering through, wounds and cuts to the spirit marking each man as he comes understands the gravity of the battle we face and the scale of the lie perpetuated. It is a hard path, one that can break a spirit or harden him beyond all empathy to the kin who share his burden. Hence the push for altruism within our own kin, I know it's tradition to treat our situation with mockery and diatribe (which I cannot deny, has it's uses) to numb the pain and fears but I prefer the holistic approach, something I believe you yourself also favour from your viewpoints.</div>

In a way, you are creating the very lightest trance.<br><br>3. Bring your hands together, palms touching and fingers pointing upward. The palm chakras, called Laogong, located in the center of the palms, should be touching. These chakras are areas where Qi can be felt emanating from the body.<br><br>4. Slowly move your hands, keeping the chakras aligned. When they are about 12 inches (30 cm) apart, slowly move them together using the least amount of physical effort possible.<br><br>5. You will be compressing the air between them like an accordion would.<br><br>6. Feel a warm or tingling sensation at the Laogong points on your palms.<br><br>7. Move your hands slowly back and forth, varying the range of the bellows. Repeat the accordion technique in different directions: horizontally, vertically, and diagonally."<br><br>Do that for fifteen minutes a day and your life will genuinely change forever. After you get the hang of it, your technique will naturally develop. I only really use the accordion exercise to measure specific internal exercises and know when it's no longer necessary to keep going. Just remember, the development isn't your skill of the exercise but more your understanding of self and the universe.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">I am still formulating how to explain honour in an honourless world so as a break from expounding on that topic here are a few brief tidbits concerning a classic /sig/ staple; food.<br><br>Ah, a good meal, there are few things better than a hearty home cooked dinner on a chill autumn night, although maybe the feel of the first splash cold mineral water hitting the back of your throat on a hot summers day is a close second. So then why do so few enjoy a properly cooked meal or good drinks, why do they go straight for something slathered in preservatives or in permafrost from the back of the freezer? Two factors, convenience and a lack of knowledge. Now, this being a /sig/ thread I do hope I don't have to expound on the weakening effects of convenience for it is the bane of any man seeking drive so the second part, knowledge, is where I shall focus my efforts on tonight.<br><br>So a general overview. We all know the classic phrase "you are what you eat". Well, it is basically true, you *are* what you eat, if you devour preservatives, injected chemical slop, starchy carbohydrates and poor fats then you in turn will find yourself sluggish, lacking in clarity of mind, likely overweight and most certainly of poor skin complexion and possibly close to diabetes. The modern diet is a true representation of this miserable age, it is unfulfilling and frankly poisonous. So how does one break out of the cycle? <br><br>- Firstly, drinks. Have you ever had a glance at the content of those foul energy drinks that so many seem endeared too despite them containing less caffeine than a black coffee, more chemicals than a meth lab and the supposed boost of vitamins? Or perhaps wondered about just what allows Cola to clean coins akin to soaking them in vinegar? Now good friend, consider just what these drinks are doing to your insides and your health overall as your body absorbs them. Full of synthetic ingredients and countless additives (yes that includes the sugar free ones, your still tricking your brain into thinking it's receiving sugar with those), they reap a tally on a mans body causing anything from caffeine withdrawals, vitamin imbalances, drops in mental acuity with the more sugary or chemically endowed ones, increases in body fat as the sugar is unable to be processed and a myriad of other problems. However in this age of boundless consumerism where everything is a commodity what does one do? Simple, you return to the basics. Those bottles of cola or whichever drink you enjoy on a daily basis, switch it to mineral or spring water (anything not listed mineral or spring is basically tap water, do not bother with it and be sure to check the waters source location). It is often cheaper, readily available and despite popular opinion, after a while of drinking it you'll notice different brands do indeed taste different. As an aside I personally favour San Pellegrino, it makes for a nice treat. If you struggle to surrender the requirement for a carbonated beverage then switch to carbonated mineral/spring water in it's place as a good first step, it helps trick the minds expectation of the usual fizzy chemical slop. Need a pick me up with a bit more oomph than a refreshing mineral water, well, black coffee makes for a great start, just remember no sugar. While yes there is a good argument for dropping caffeine all together such a step is a large one therefore offering an alternative to your average can of Monster or Red Bull is useful until a man reaches that point (I would be remiss if I did not admit that I have yet to quit it myself). Oh and do not fret about potentially losing those "vitamins" in these drinks as unbeknownst to most you urinate a good portion of them out, you'll get most required vitamins from a good diet.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Oh and to "head it off at the pass" as they say, yes be mindful of the brands of water you buy due to the plastic bottles holding them (although this rule applies to *all* bottled drinks generally). Nestl√© had a brief stint of fame for their bottles literally rotting into the fluids on store shelves and I shouldn't have to tell you of the dangers of plastic fibers within a human system. Yes, I know *all* plastic bottles pose a problem however buying mineral water in glass bottles is prohibitively expensive therefore unfeasible for most. We must operate within reality, not a fantasy where one can buy fourteen liters of Voss water a week. Oh and never buy "artisinal" mineral water, it is literally a meme designed for the stupid and those with too much money.<br><br>Milk is and shall always be excellent for you and if you can find it, unhomogenized is most excellent indeed. Needless to say, the homogenized and pasteurised milk most places stock is a rather far cry from the proper stuff which makes any benefits from it far more limited than what one could consider closer to the source. Also do not buy the half fat or minimal fat milk concept, it's essentially the watered down version, you want full milk with the least tampering possible, even if overweight. I do know the argument against milk is fairly well presented and if you do have a counter do not hesitate to share but as a general rule I have few qualms with it on it's own, as in everything drink in moderation.  Yes our bodies *can* struggle with it depending on certain issues but it's benefits at this juncture outweigh the negatives for most.<br><br>Fruit juices are moderately passable however you must bear in mind two things. One, they are full of sugar, often more than most carbonated beverages and secondly your natural diet would not have access to all fruits all times of the year, while they can be useful to supplement diets with vitamins and other benefits they are not a crutch to rely on. Downing a liter of Orange juice a day is not a healthy diet, it is merely an alternative to downing that two liter bottle of coke.<br><br>Regarding alcohol, beyond the vital rule of moderation, there are a few things to remember. Firstly, if you do not enjoy alcohol or just drink to be social then just skip alcohol all together. There is no purpose to it and it is far too easy for a good man to fall to it's numbing effects, it is a burden more than a joy for most. It is a greater man who rejects it outright than a man who raises a glass just to fit in.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">But for those who partake of these beverages, let us begin. Beers, IPA's and the like are indeed poor for you. The "man breasts" from certain chemicals does hold a modicum of truth to it and generally they are just hard for you to digest. It would be worthwhile just removing them all together if you intend to go full /sig/ but for some it is a small concession to enjoy a cold beer after a long day so I won't go too hard on it. Unless of course it's cider in which case unless your living a very active lifestyle and able to burn calories at an expedited rate you should just avoid. It's pure sugar and to be honest good ciders are just so hard to find these days that it's worth just cutting them completely. Most grain based beverages as a general rule are not the best for you which indeed includes the ever popular whiskey but very careful moderation means you can mayhaps have them once in a while but if you have regular social gatherings it is wise to just avoid all together. "Good" alcohols, or rather those with the least detrimental effects, would be Brandys, Cognacs, Red Wines (not the cheaper ones though bear in mind), certain Vodkas. My advice overall concerning alcohol is simple; do not drink to fit in nor to forget, if you wish to imbibe it just buy a middle to high end bottle of something nice that doesn't turn once opened (I personally enjoy a nice bottle of Aug√≠er brandy that lasts a couple of months) and maybe have a glass every friday night, just one to savour as you unwind. Something to drink slowly, not something to down to drown out any concerns you may be having. It is too easy for a man to fall into this trap and frankly I feel uncomfortable even discussing alcohol but it is a subject sometimes touched upon in some circles.<br><br>There are other drinks which can be suggested beyond this basic primer, for instance I recall a discussion on Kefir which was interesting with it's gut bacteria and the ability to homebrew quite easily but that's out of my area of expertise so if anyone has a screencap of those kind of recipes of suggestions it would be helpful.<br><br>- So now we move onto the more malleable section, food. This in an ironic twist is far more simple; actually learn to cook. Now I do not mean learn some fine French cuisine or mastering some complex dish but rather advocate three simple rules;<br><br>Use fresh ingredients<br>Make the dish simple<br>Do not be afraid of failure<br><br>Now often you'll find when a man finishes work or seeks a quick snack he will seek the simple and easy, he has become accustomed to being lazy and will gladly devour any reprocessed garbage from a plastic bag no matter how disgusting it is. He lives in what one could term a "hyper reality" where instead of looking at the chicken tendie or nugget as the poorest cuts of meat from a hormone injected chicken mushed together with countless other chemicals then coated in cheap fats and breadcrumb, he will instead see a delicious piece of golden chicken and his gormless mouth will open and devour it, offering praise to his semetic overseers for such a fine offering as he was told he would get in their advertising. This is the bane of the modern mans diet, this illusion. True food, real food, must be crafted by yourself. So where to begin? Should you throw out everything in the freezer and make your own garden patch where everything is fresh and proudly tended to regularly. Well, yes, but let us be realistic here, only a few will go that far so a balance must be struck for those who will not (although you really should, it is quite a pleasant sensation cooking your own home grown ingredients).</div>

  <div class="divMessage">So firstly dispose of any and all snacks which are processed from your diet. Yes I do mean all. Crisps (or chips as their known in the state), bars of chocolate, those little packs of cheap cooked "meat" that are easy to eat through, remove it all. Beyond the clear nutritional problems these things cause, you have the fact that they are *too* easy to eat, they are too tempting. This goes for whether you are fat or slim, they contain very little good for you beyond maybe some protein in the meat and even then they will usually contain other negative attributes that counter that. Luncheon meats such as pepperoni and chorizo are passable to keep but even those must be eaten in moderation.<br><br>Moving onto the main components of a dinner, you also need to drop *all* processed meats, all of them. If you wish to eat meat then buy fresh, it's quite simple really. A good bit of chicken or beef will last a few days in the fridge and can be easily prepared within under half an hour with your own seasoning and garnish. There are a great many perks to switching to fresh, firstly nutrients will be higher, secondly you know the process of preparation for you yourself are doing it therefore no additional additives or chemicals, thirdly cooking is a vital and easy skill to attain. Yes one must be mindful of the type of fresh meat he buys for even this can contain hormone injections and the like, a good method is to bite the bullet and seek grass fed or organic meat. It is a bit more expensive but then this is a proper meal, you *must* get out the mindset of cheap and easy for that is what is trapping you. If your working on a budget a good method I used to use would be visiting the supermarket rather than a dedicated butcher an hour or two before closing when the remaining good cuts or packs are reduced, buying a decent amount of the good stuff, storing enough in the fridge to last a time then freezing the rest for later, it saves money and saves further visits to a supermarket. If your finding meat is close to going off consider a stew and leave it to slowly simmer over night or some such, there are many inventive ways to use meat even if it's just before it's going to turn. Also when cooking meat while oil is fairly common consider switching to either extra virgin olive oil or a decent quality butter (actual butter, not the horrible pretenders you get in supermarkets). Both have higher burning points and more nutrients in the case of butter. Rapeseed and it's cohorts is a hipster meme, don't even bother with it.<br><br>Fresh vegetables are usually a fair bit better than frozen but the frozen can work decently if in a pinch, they sometimes lose their flavour and nutrients a tad in the time between chopping and freezing in the factory compared to freshly cut ones but for the most part they *should* be untampered. I use a fair bit of frozen garlic and onion for my cooking due to the expediency and the fact it has nothing added, it's a good choice although I find the garlic can lack the oomph of freshly crushed.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">No doubt some will be of course craving a sweet treat as a dessert or maybe a snack, this is often a stumbling block for those who seek to lose weight. The temptation and habitual gorging of chocolate can be a hard beast to tame but it is possible, you merely need to be smart about it. Try switching to a fruit at first, any fruit, just to get used to moving from the overly sweet sensation of chocolates or candies. Now no doubt a nutritionist is reeeing as he reads that but allow me to continue as he no doubt will understand my next point. Now you have become adjusted to fruit, move from what I would assume is a high sugar one such as apples, grapes or bananas to one of low sugar such as watermelon (cue negroid meme in response), peaches, oranges or lemons. Slowly, over time you will begin to become adjusted to these lower sugar alternatives and find yourself no longer craving the high fructose, high calorie sugar you did previously. If you *must* have some chocolate then consider a dark chocolate with a high cocoa percentile, while still not exactly wonderful for you it is better than the milk stuff.<br><br><br>So these were just as stated, a primer for the arena of food and a very basic one at that. There are far more avenues to cover such as changing from plastic cooking utensils to cast iron, recipes, cooking advice, avoiding meme diets and so much more including things I have probably missed in the primer. If you take nothing else from this, at least take this away; there is a reason the poor quality food is in abundance and the items actually good for you cost more. They want you fat, lazy and unthinking, they consider you a unit to consume more and more. Like as in all things of this age you must find a way to rise above it and food is one of the most important aspects of it for it is literally our fuel. Take great care of your body and it will take care of the mind that inhabits it.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Upon a topic that all should take to heart; the subject of understanding the opposition. I shall not be looking at the matter of "crying out as they strike you" or of pilpul as they have been covered extensively elsewhere.<br><br>A term often thrown around is the "End of History", a popular concept within the sphere of European well being. More often than not it is packaged as the idea of history no longer being relevant just after the fall of the Soviet Union, the "last big threat" to the world falling as the "Democratic" and "Enlightened" nations cheered on despite it's own peoples subtle enslavement and unending ignorance of the fates bound to them being a distorted mirror of the more overt semetic Communist concepts of the Eastern bloc. It is a queer thing is it not, to reflect upon these things. Especially when one looks at where things have arrived now, an age that sought to use Weimar as a template has not merely done that but surpassed it in various ways with nary an efficient push back nor victory by the supposed opponents of this degeneration. Oh, we all know why, the semetic puppeteers ensuring both sides dance to the rhythm of ethnic self hatred and self destruction, poisons so foul and permeating everything that those who seek to rid themselves of it still must wallow in their shallows to a degree as it erodes every last island of nobility and sanity in our dying civilisations. <br><br>Many know this but for those who do not, this is the reason for the destruction and dismemberement of our history for in that, in epochs now passed, we have sought hope and inspiration from heroes and their teachings so that we may follow in their footsteps and that we may not merely become them but if possible surpass them while honouring their ideals. This is why in place of these Men we are offered the pathetic and corrupted simulacrum of greatness in the form of the modern "hero" be him clad in spandex or a vacuous action "hero" but also why for those seeking real leaders you will only find either approved psuedo Communist "revolutionaries" or supposed "thought leaders" offering only meekest and most kosher ideals available for public consumption for anything outside these bounds is "undemocratic" or "can't work". Thusly we must understand it is not merely the End of History that is sought but the very death of it, all that is to remain for most of our people being a brief epitaph upon a neglected memorial should the enemy complete their work.<br><br>Thusly the parasite, has in essense, perfected the drone. Oh, it is not purely done by history erasure of course, there are many more steps to such a thing but our history is a pivotal cornerstone to a man understanding his place within the world, shatter it and you make him malleable to all the other foul schemes you have in play for he no longer has his true identity, only the faux ideals you force upon him. Now this drone, this "last man" if you wish to employ Nietzsches concept, is a simple beast. Consume, submit to your own degradation and offer tribute. His nature is that of simple, rationalized machinery. Oh he will think himself "unique", an "individual" as he consumes and submits like his surrounding kin, all his protestations to the contrary hollow much like his soul. This is the fallen state of the European Man. This humiliation of our people by the semite is a very deliberate act you may notice for they will nary en mass partake in what they deem "good" for our society beyond an occasional "sacrificial lamb", most rather sell it then sit back laughing as they watch our fall from grace and their vile elevation to power brokers and masters. It is almost akin to the disgusting BDSM rituals where a "slave" is "broken in", their will subsumed by that of their abusers. Make no mistake, for them, this act is both sanctioned by their own texts and embraced as their racial norms despite the protestations of "based" semites decrying it. This is the very reason they call us "goyim".</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Now this drone, despite being a simple creature, is multifaceted in that it can not merely be used as a source of sustenance in both the financial and physical form (if you wish to know the physical please seek information regarding the Israeli sex trade, the financiers who partake in the vile act of child abuse and certain Talmudic rituals concerning blood) but also in the form of a weapon. Many view groups such as Antifa and their ilk as nary but "brainwashed liberals" which while not an inaccurate observation it does lacks understanding. They are what one could term "true believers" by and large, drones so reliant upon the semetic poisons offered that to exist outside it is akin to death. How many times have you heard of some "open minded backpacker" who was raped and mutilated in some backwater desert wastes because they were told "were all one race, the human race", how many times have you witnessed the soulless eyes and motions of these creatures as they parade through the streets, all cognition beyond their diseased false reality ignored as they believe themselves to be right even in the face of their own puppeteers and abusers tell them to hate themselves. In times past these men and women may of been shown a better way, a way to truly live and to serve a greater purpose but now the indoctrination is so great that to break them out of it would be to shatter their now darkened souls for they know nothing beyond the semetic illusion they live in. <br><br>We must consider the greater ramifications of what has been done to these people however. Their existence is what one could term a heightened state of blissful ignorance when imbued with a false sense of power and righteousness. Power for they will not be stopped by corrupted and malignant state, righteousness for they do truly believe the illusion they live in. This is the ultimate humiliation ritual by the semite. To turn brother against brother with a lie is one thing, it weakens the bonds and weakens the bulwarks of unity, to instead reshape the mind, body and spirit to a lesser form is the ultimate form of degradation. Some believe the rape of our innocent and the selling of genital mutilation to those unable to defend themselves to be their gravest sins but I would posit that these acts are more spiteful and fueled by their own doctrines, the far greater horror lies within the ability to break our people down to become such vile animals serving their every whim. A rape within their key domains of power or the violation of sexual organs and sexual identity, while truly disturbing are only part of the overarching picture. To destroy a person into loving their abuser, this reaches far further than those actions (that is not to say these acts are any less an atrocity but we must remember to tally every count done against us and understand the threats accordingly). <br><br>Yes, there is a significant increase in those waking up to the perpetrators of these acts, the internet has allowed the free flow of information (something they are desperate to stem the flow of) however the opposite is also true, the indoctrination within academia and media is degenerating more and more of our kin. An invisible line is being drawn in the sand, upon one side is us, the Men of Action willing to defend our right to exist, upon the other is the semite and his puppets and upon the line itself is the remaining confused masses, swaying back and forth until finally choosing to resist or to submit. Both sides will reach a critical mass at one point or another and when that mass is reached then the Steel of our spines and our Will shall be truly tested against the parasite and it's golems.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">They know we love our kin and will do what it takes to save them, this is certain and this is why they fight so desperately to denigrate them and reforge them into lesser being. They are human shields for the parasite and have been manipulated into believing this purpose is a "good thing". Alongside them are the golems imported from far off lands, barbarous people presented as "the same as you" despite their natures and actions against us, more subjects to offer tribute to puppet masters who they claim to hate yet suckle at the teet of, their insatiable desires used as a tool get them to attack the native peoples of Europa. The negro desires more welfare and more fatty foods, the arab and his kin desire more debasement of host populations and more entertainment, I could go on but I shan't belabor the point.<br><br>Make no mistake, they hate you. They hate everything you represent for they resent that their foul nature cannot emulate it thusly they must tear it down or corrupt it. This is why they fight us so, why they act only in cowardice and treachery. They wish to reforge us in their own image, submission to them is akin to death of the spirit. But we must remember we are above them, we are not kin to them and must forever resist lowering ourselves to their level. We must embody all that makes us unique as the sons of Europa, all that makes us noble and above their machinations. One could almost pity the parasite, such frothing hatred at those who could create while they could only subvert and corrupt. Almost but not quite.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#75895">&gt;&gt;75895</a><br>Decent posts, yet again. I hope you're spreading this message across multiple locations. As many have complained and I'm willing to admit, this board has minimal traffic. The shills must be outed even when numbers dwindle. There's no way around that, otherwise the board falls to degeneracy.<br><br>On the subject of he who believes himself unique and individual, I believe the concept of the parasitic psychiatrists pushing the ego is a major problem with that. To counter it, these drones as you called them need to be re-taught that they are not just a "self". Our people are us. We are our people. That there is no good to come of separating from our ancestral backgrounds and denying our heritage.<br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#75896">&gt;&gt;75896</a><br>Antifa as reliant drones, yes. I have had conversations with Communists. They don't believe as we do that they're subversive, hateful, destructive footsoldiers of ZOG. In their minds, they believe they're "doing the right thing". In Universities where Communist professors are indoctrinating impressionable minds, the often-times jewish instructor impresses on them that the system is bad and there must be a revolution to fight it. The enemies they're taught to fear of course, are "Nazis" but they've no idea what National Socialism even is. There's only a cloud of lies to fuddle their minds with. They're taught "history has lied about Lenin he was really a good person" bullshit and the same about Karl Marx. Should the indoctrinated youth discover the fact that the last Tsar was brutally butchered by the Bolsheviks along with his entire family and servants, he or she is told that the Tsar was an evil man and there "had to be collateral damage". The mass starvation of Holodomor lied about as a "famine they had no control of" etc. Excuses abound. Constant semetic interference with every breath the parasite breathes into words being lies, but lies which (you're right) they do shape their minds, bodies and spirits towards the foul Communist way of thinking. I have converted a few. The way to reach them is not to declare the most logical choice of loyalty to National Socialism. That must come later after the light of true words shine through into their poisoned minds. I have attended Universities under Marxist jewish professors and passed through the fire of their deceptions. Can't say I came out unscathed. More that I came out furious at the filth being peddled. As you said, both sides of those aware vs. the parasite and their puppets will reach critical mass; I believe it will happen only as a mirror of the history of the Weimar Republic before Hitler took power. When no-one can buy bread and the rich no longer have any control due to the paper that is money finally devolving into what it always was. Nothing but garbage. The frog in the pot analogy. Gradually increase the heat, and the frog cooks alive. When heat increases instantly, it jumps out. The same will happen towards those whom instantly lose their luxuries and can't afford to survive. They'll be pissed. Following the illusion of semetic lies will no longer be a solution to them. Survival instincts should lead them back to proper thinking. I'm not promoting accelerationism here. I'm speaking of inevitability. Critical mass is bound to happen, as it has throughout history when the tribe has been involved. Nations have always eventually grown wise to their tricks and cast them out.<br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#75897">&gt;&gt;75897</a><br>Nobility has it's place, but the meaning must not be misunderstood. One who is noble cannot hold onto their kingdom and people by letting foreign invasions tread on their lands. Nobility, historically, never survived or conquered without wise strategic maneuvers. Some lone shooters here and there dispatching very few of the low-hanging fruit of common negroes in shopping malls, arabs in mosques and parasites in a synagogue are never planning for the bigger picture. The larger prizes. All they're doing is allowing ZOG to increase their stranglehold through mock calls for sympathy of their kind against both European and displaced European American citizens.</div>

One who is noble cannot hold onto their kingdom and people by letting foreign invasions tread on their lands.</span><br>Quite true, people too often conflate the noble with "being kind and fair" but it goes far beyond that. It means when in times of crisis being unflinching in your resolve to achieve something, keeping faith and Will even when all around you is chaos. A noble ruler may need be unjust at times, even callous, but as long as it is in pursuit of the greater goal the action is no less noble, mayhaps it is even more so for he is more likely to understand that he himself may have to become a monster for a period and shoulders that responsibility without fear regardless. He accepts these burdens without complaint and does what needs to be done. Upon the other side of the coin, as you rightly mentioned, the "lone wolf" types who often believe their cause just which in a fashion can be perceived by some as that but they never have the wisdom or foresight to see the outcome of their actions as you rightly point out. Their concept of nobility is a warped one, one lacking the true gravitas of the idea, it is entirely based upon the now, never the tomorrow. There is no greater plan than "shoot now", the bloodshed and horror caused only serving to tighten the parasites grip upon our throats. They react to the pain in an animalistic fashion, uncaring of the results from trying to alleviate it in the worst possible way. Yes there may come a time of blood, the parasite is ensuring it will be so, but needless murder for the sake of unfocused rage will only hurt those they claim to fight for. Wounded men that could of had a higher purpose, that *sought* a higher purpose, only to be consumed in their own pain and hatred. It is a sad sight.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Upon a topic that has been preying on my mind as of late; the importance of unification of purpose. I have little doubt most present here understand this issue but many do not hence I believe it has a need for exploration.<br><br>We are a proud race and rightly so. We have achieved much, our history and development stretching far beyond what most can perceive of our history. Each unique culture and nation born from the peoples of Europa has a different character that compliments one another in a myriad of different ways creating a tapestry of such grandeur that it is no wonder the semetic tribe seek it's destruction, their darkened hearts filled with loathing for such a thing of beauty. Oh, it is most certainly true brother beset brother long before the parasite lurched it's way towards our shores, battles over resources, barbed words and religious schisms. But unlike those not of our ilk, we knew when to stop. We knew when enough was enough and returned to our homes to continue our lives anew, our teeth sharpened within the fires of conflict, those standing after it creating new generations of hardier men while cowards lay scattered and forgotten. Atleast until the age of unfettered semetic commerce and the seeping corruption it brings that infested the hearts of Men who should of represented our finest, their succumbing to the lust for gold inflicting a disease we have suffered for over a century. The times of those blood lettings have long passed however, and in it's place instead of a budding respect or a unity of purpose we instead find internecine conflict, what once was light comradery morphed into barbs of "le 56% face", "the eternal anglo", "cucked canucks" and so much more. Without question the source of this thinking was of a much more sinister nature than most know but the effectiveness of this sowing of hatred proved itself with the disunity common among brothers who share the same battle. Men we should be standing shoulder to shoulder with instead passing blame to everyone around with scathing tones. <br><br>There is but one real way to counter this shameful conduct. We must each recognise the nature of our own subset of people and how it has been manipulated. I will offer my own as an example, that of the sons of Albion. We are a haughty people. We are obsessed with protocol, we can be uptight as anything yet by the same token distinctly unbecoming in conduct at other times. We can be welcoming yet quiet when offense is taken, the anger simmering until it is finally released in a wave of fury. We have grown arrogant in our perceived "superiority", the allowance of "British pride" being only in things that have served the parasite, be it the vile treachery of our leaders during World War 2, our cumbersome and crumbled Empire, our "humble acceptance" of "colonial subjects" into our lands or pride regarding the "power of London", an adulation of the most fetid and vile city imaginable, a nest of vipers and traitors. This unwarranted sense of pride in the false is what has set us apart from kin for so long, gone is the brotherly relations between the Germanic and British powers of the 19th century, instead we self segregate into pedantic mockeries such as /britpol/ (which in truth is little more than an English enclave), the degenerative self adulation never ceasing as men who should be standing with us instead utter the word "lad" after every sycophantic congratulations of the most trivial and pointless of discussions.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Some attribute such a thing to a desperate need to have some "British identity" yet they fail to understand the greater ramifications of their actions, an abandonment of those we owe a debt of brotherhood to and the illusion that our identity is nothing else. There is no remembrance of Alfred the Great who forged a people anew, there is no pride in our ancient traditions and folk tales, at best I witnessed the joke of "druidpol" larping as neo pagans but never sharing deeper insights or teachings into the traditions of our people. The Scots, Irish and Welsh have managed to salvage some of their tradition but far too many have either had that identity hijacked from adulation of their history and culture into hating the common English (a subject I touch on a little more indepth here <a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#72192">&gt;&gt;72192</a> and in further posts offer examples of the deliberate manipulation of the peoples of Britain. We are not innocent but nor are our current people to blame) or have fallen into the same trap as the English themselves and hum the same merry tune of adulation of this Age of Misery rather than embracing the truth of their identity and an acceptance of the burdens we must bear. We must recognise this error and correct it. We must move from hiding behind our shields and embrace that challenge, clasp the hands of our brothers and understand the wrongs done to them by our leaders so we can thusly hold the line with them lest we all be lost. It is only through understanding our purpose as the guardians of Europa that we can truly make right the wrongs committed, even if they were committed in ignorance of truths that were hidden. We have been isolated too long and I would ask any son of Albion who claims he is true to his people to follow such an example for they are our blood. Honour must be restored for otherwise the parasite will forever divide us and complete it's vile task.<br><br>This however is a story not unique to the British people but is echoed throughout in different ways and by different means. While this particularly brief exploration of the modern British "nationalist" identity may offer some insight into where this particular group has gone wrong many other groups are inflicted with deficits forced upon them from the parasite also. We all in some form or another have developed conclaves, temporary bulwarks set in sand as we ignore the cries of our brothers, their lands beset by animals raping their children and defiling their women. In place of anger at the injustice done to them some sit back and mock. "Oh the effeminate Swede, we wouldn't take that". "Oh the cucked German, serves them right for accepting Merkel", it is all a mirror of the arrogance of the British as I mentioned before. Yes it may be done from a different perspective, for instance some consider it "tough love", hoping the brutal mockery will illicit some anger or reaction but when it is their own brothers enmasse doing so they feel defeated and abandoned for there is no one at their backs offering help.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">The true irony is that these things are already happening in the lands of the accusers themselves, the parasite already has in place what it needs to ensure every nation of Europa and her colonies will suffer the same fate. This is the inherit danger of the parasites machinations, to force us to mock in place of help, to distract us with our brothers dire situation in nihilistic delight so that we may ignore the atrocities happening in our lands for "something worse is happening to someone else haha". It is truly despicable. We must accept the things happening are not unique to our particular region but is part of a greater scheme and thusly each and every count must be taken, not just those done to our own. The crime done to one nation of Europa or her colonies is a crime done to all, this must be our mindset.<br><br>We must purge ourselves of these forced concepts of separation if we are to unite as a people, we must at a fundamental level understand and value the fact we are all European. We must stand tall and proud as exemplars of this and lift our brothers up no matter where they be. We must reinforce where they in particular are weakest and accept their aid where we need help none of us fight alone. The few of us here who understand Unity, we will raise the battered banners of those who fought before us and carry them to the end of the line no matter the cost even if it seems meaningless to some for we stand for every one of our people. But we are few and need brothers to help lift our standards higher so more may see there is still Men holding firm, that there is still a battle to fight. At this juncture, in this time of turmoil, it is not your money nor your materials we need to win this fight but your faith and your strength. The strength to raise your voice in unison with your brothers in saying we will not fall and the strength to lift him back to his feet when he is wounded. Your faith that the man by your side will stand with you no matter how dark the hour grows and that each of us will see this conflict to it's conclusion. With one voice we must speak, with one purpose we must fight. <br><br>For all the peoples of Europa we march, unbound and unshackled until victory be won.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">So tonight is a somewhat melancholic topic inspired by another thread upon this board. Upon the subject of finding comfort, or more precisely that feeling of home.<br><br>It's a simple thing isn't it, recalling the last time you felt truly at "home", truly comfortable. No concerns, no worries, just the simple warmth of believing all is right with the world. Any man who claims not to miss it is an outright liar for every man desires peace in his time for both himself and those he loves. He desires the warmth of a comfortable place he had once called his own, be it memories of his childhood home, a place he spent most of his younger years with his friends or the simple feeling of love at close grandparents or family members. It all seemed so simple then did it not? I recall even in my own childhood looking from my open bedroom window of the seemingly endless vista of London and in my innocence thinking "I'm glad I'm home". I would sit on my bed with a glass of coke, maybe play the playstation a little before turning on the radio and listening to evening call in shows while the sun set over the metropolis before me. Even on the chilly nights I'd leave my bedroom window open, listening to the distant city for it's noises comforted me. In a way I still miss it to this day. Oh, don't get me wrong, I absolutely despise the city of London, what it has become and was probably already becoming back then with it's degenerative undercurrent, it's a pit. But in my young mind it was home, the sprawling suburbs where I'd meet with friends, play some football (or soccer as it is also referred) even though I was terrible at it. All of it gone now. Memories of a simpler time always seem so beautiful don't they? <br><br>There in lies the issue though. They are just memories, moments gone. In desperation some seek to keep in that feeling, holding onto those brief moments in the hopes that even for an instant they can feel that again but truthfully it can never be done much. It always puts me in mind of a man looking back upon his first love and asks "what if" as if the thought of it will offer that feeling of fiery love once more. There's a particular phrase that comes to mind concerning this, "You can never go home". In essense this is true, we can never go home for home isn't there any more. Whether like me you saw your city engulfed in the unending torrent of diversity and it's ensuing corrosion, whether you grew up rural and seek revisit a place long abandoned, nothing ever feels as it did back then. The walls crumble, the people have left or passed on, the shell of it is just a sad reminder of all that has been lost. Even the strongest of Men feel a pang of melancholy at such things.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">For some this feeling, this need for the warmth back, it stifles, it hinders as you grasp around in desperation for that brief moment of reprieve, for just a mere moment of it back but it can never been found, not truly. This is something we must not merely accept but understand. For most of us, our family homes are long gone and the places that gave us that feeling forever lost. Once upon a time even when he left home, a son of Europa would still feel at home in his lands for even as a stranger he could still find belonging, still find a quiet corner to make his own, raise a family to share his love with and create this feeling anew. We have been deprived of this, this comfort, for our lands have been taken and given to all. Our communities dying, our people shiftless and lost in the misery of this epoch, it is no wonder the warmth of our people is replaced by the soulless, wretched commercialism so prevalent. Can they truly be blamed when all that is offered is the threat of encroaching ethnic violence and a hollow existence? The parasite has taken so much from us and this theft is one of the most egregious.<br><br>Part of our goal if we are to become the Men we need to be is to understand we can not go back, we cannot find comfort in the things we once had but by the same token we must realise it will not be gone forever. As we stride forward we must remember that a part of our goal is this, this simple concept of returning this feeling within ones own lands and among ones own people, this must be part of what we must bring back to our people even if it means we may never get it in our own lifetimes. I know it's hard along this path, it can be incredibly lonely being the Men we are and the burdens we carry, staring at the storm on the horizon, the prospect of stopping it can seem overwhelming but stop it we will. No, we will not merely stop it but turn it back unto those who forced it upon us. Our people, our families and our children depend on it. They deserve, nay, demand that we do so so that we can give them what we ourselves have lost. So they can feel that warmth and that joy of comfort, of not fearing for a future most uncertain. We must be the ones to return this gift to our people for who else is better suited than those who feel this sense of loss. There is no greater gift than that of love, anyone who has felt it knows this. That is what we once had and with it stripped a piece of our souls has been torn away and replaced with cold rationalised machinery. It is our duty to ensure those who come after us do not feel this, that they are stronger than our forebears who watched the world die were and that they themselves know that feeling once more. That they have a true family, a true people that is their own. Carry the memories of comfort with you but do not mourn them, use them as a reminder of what your fighting for. <br><br>We'll make it together. As friends, as family, as brothers. Come what may, what we do shapes the future, it forms around our actions or inaction. So if you wish to find comfort again then help make it a reality. Find those who seek what we seek, raise them up as others have done for you and we can forge a better tomorrow free of this sadness.</div>

People became more colder and distant after this and the countless wars that happened around Europe in the next decades.<br><br>It's good that we know it and strive for better, though. I don't think normies will ever care for it though. Current zeitgeist is pretty much being uncaring and detached from people in general</div>

  <div class="divMessage">I feel I have been neglectful in my duty of expounding upon /sig/ topics so tonight I intend to rectify my failings and offer some further thoughts. For tonight my brothers, we shall take a slight breather from the heavier duty topics and move onto what one could term a "comfy" topic, that of literature and your cultural inheritance within it. Many are already familiar with the work of Spengler, perhaps even E. Micheal Jones (although come now, while some of his work holds merit, his inability to conflate race with clear ethnic propensities does get tiresome) or even pieces such as the raw power of My Struggle or nobility of Tomorrow We Live or the ideals within the works of Hegel, these are all fine texts but for this night it is wish to bring you home. To gift you back what was taken.<br><br>Ah, literature. You know, a movie can attempt to produce a facsimile of the imagination with all the grand special effects, unending budget and semetic subversions as it wishes but little is comparable to the vistas a good piece of literature can present. It can deliver you from the mundane and degenerate into a beautiful if brief reprieve from the modern world. The greatest of these escapes can be found not within modern literature but within the folklore and histories of old, written by men once passionate of their adulation and wonder at the stories they recorded. It is with this in mind I have begun working on a selection of suggested texts to bring you, my brothers, closer to your homelands where ever you may be. So let us begin. As a rule of thumb each region/peoples will have a listing of two suggested books, these I have chosen based on my owning of the physical books and completion of them. There are many more I could suggest but without ownership and the reading of them first I would be remiss to list them in case of making a poor suggestion. One suggestion will be a fairly accessible book based around pure enjoyment of ones own culture, the other will be more scholarly and niche but a worthy addition.<br><br>Greek;<br><br>Ah, so let us begin fairly early. Now while most modern men will only share a partial lineage if any at all to ancient Greeks, they do make for an interesting precursor to look at regarding ancient tales. One of the finest collection of stories regarding them would be the Herodotus Histories. Now do not be put off by it's grand and seemingly opaque title, a good translation of this book (seek a early to mid century release) is actually quite easy to read and enjoyable to boot. It tells many a tale of ancient Greece and paints a fairly good picture of the times. A good piece but one I would consider ancillary to the more focused folklore of the specific tales of our peoples (unless of course one is Greek in which case, well, most certainly read and treasure).<br><br>Now Greek myths and legends are widely recorded and choosing a single book on the subject is... troublesome. One of my personal favorites is the Aeneid however it is most certainly one of the toughest books to finish which can deprive one of enjoyment. The language can be prosaic, it's very dense and it can go into somewhat exhaustive detail on mundane things once in a while. If your the scholarly sort, then this is a must have. If your seeking pleasure, well maybe just go for a early 20th century text covering the myths at large, there's a great many to choose from that are less, shall we say, arduous. I really do have a love hate relationship to this book, I really do.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Germanic;<br><br>Many a man can claim to, in some form or another, descend from the Germanic clans that once roamed the European continent and with good reason. Despite the fragmentation of these peoples through countless conflict and struggles, there is a myriad of texts connecting them none the less. Even my own kin, the now reviled Anglo Saxon (for good or ill pending ones perspective) can claim ancestry to these clans and it shows within the folklores sharing links and themes. To this end I have chosen a small selection of texts you may wish to seek to explore the themes and tales passed down. Now when discussing Germanic folklore and culture, there has been an ever present jewel, a location one may consider to be a thing of beauty; the Rhine. It is with this in mind my first suggestion for those seeking to get closer to their Germanic roots would be to seek a copy of Hero Tales And Legends Of The Rhine by Lewis Spence, 1918. It contains a wonderful array of tales and myths intrinsic to understanding the soul of the Germanic people. It is one I cannot suggest enough, I honestly cannot. I would most certainly suggest attaining an early 20th century copy, the art included is quite stunning and copies can be fairly cheap, usually somewhere between ¬£15-40 ($18-45) pending it's state of repair.<br><br>To follow this up, for the man seeking something both a touch older and a greater understanding of the deeper roots I would ardently suggest Tacitus' Germania. Now for those unfamiliar with Tacitus, do bear in mind when reading this, it is taken from a very Roman perspective, essentially a man who had had a soft life. What is most interesting is though he does not paint them quite as barbaric as modern media would make one think, infact he does denote a fair bit of their honourable conduct, but again, do remember, he is viewing them from a hostile side. To suppliment this I would suggest also visiting Bitchute and seeking a chap called Asha Logos, he actually does a rather fantastic coverage of the ancient Germanic tribes here if you seek to understand them further;<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/QIzCwJxMQ2Rh/">https://www.bitchute.com/video/QIzCwJxMQ2Rh/</a><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/gsR5RdmuZUtq/">https://www.bitchute.com/video/gsR5RdmuZUtq/</a><br><br>Both offer enjoyable viewing and I believe he provides further sources for more texts I shan't go into at this moment for otherwise this both you and I would be here all day and we have quite a bit to cover.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">- Celtic<br><br>Good graces now here's a tough one. Celtic mythology has a vast array of myths and legends, each of which can be sourced to the Scottish and Irish. I won't include Welsh in the Celtic miasma as the Welsh have quite a deviation from the more common Celtic templates of legends but for the sake of ease of understanding I will include them in this section none the less.<br><br>So, firstly the Scottish. Now the Scots have been fairly ardent in their recording of their myths and legends but only to a partial degree. Sadly many pre Christian texts have been destroyed or lost by the more zealous enforcers of their docterine thusly we do not have complete mythologies untouched by partial Christian influences which I find a great shame. None the less we shall endure.<br><br>So firstly we shall look at not one but two books by the same author; The Celtic Dragon Myth (1911) and Popular Tales of the West Highlands (vol 1-4) (1890). Now these, these are something special. The chap in question, one J. F. Campbell made an incredible record of the slowly declining Scottish folklore during the 19th century. These two texts both suppliment each other in a number of ways with their discussions on folklore and ancient tales. Those who are of a more esoteric bent may find The Celtic Dragon especially interesting as it touches on potential Aryan roots with the tales reminiscent of certain Hindu connections, something I am informed of makes for an interesting read concerning the ancient Aryan migrations across Europe and North India, much like the symbol of the incarnations Swastika and so forth. Back onto the main topic however, the West Highlands mythology is an excellent read and definately worth your time, both are but if you only read one of these, go with that text in it's entirety. <br><br>For the more heavy reader I would suggest History of the Highland (1857) (no PDF available) by James Browne. This is what I would truly consider to be one of the most important books concerning Scottish history and culture in existence. I actually came across it purely by chance in a visit to Aberdeen a couple of years ago and noticed it in a charity shop window. It's akin to an actual tome but I believe that is due to it being the combination of two previous releases by the same author. It details the clans, their locations within the highlands, examples of tartans, folklore associated with those clans, the service of those clans within the British military and honours recieved, clan traditions, maps and so much more. The real bastard is I am truly struggling to locate a bloody PDF of it. I did however find one of the older versions which was a four volume release which looks fairly complete, think it's missing a little here and there but it should provide *quite* a bit of reading. Around two thousand-ish pages I believe? It's quite an exhaustive text but one definitely worth preserving.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Had to include the second part of the Scottish collection in this post, my apologies.<br><br>Now Irish folklore and history suffered not one but two devastating attacks, one at the hands of my own nations government and their vile predations, the other at the hands of the Church and their, as is always the case, subversion of the older lore of Ireland. Thusly I cannot begin to imagine what has been lost but it seems some valiant souls have attempted to record what they could none the less. The first and most accessable of the two suggestions for Irish history and folklore is the rather wonderful Heroic Romances of Ireland (1905-06) (two volumes) by A. H. Leahy. This is a delightful collection of Irish tales from Ireland's lost history and is thoroughly enjoyable to boot. The language can be a bit tricky to grasp on occasion but it shouldn't offer too much of a struggle for most. It also contains literal translations of the texts which also make for interesting reading and if one is inquisitive, perhaps even alternative ideas compared to the presented translation. This is one of those books that I would always suggest a physical copy of if possible although of course I have included a PDF for your convenience also.<br><br>Now this one is not so much scholarly but delves more into the odd folklore. Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry by W. B. Yeats (1888). Now two things of note concerning this. The first is this is less historical than other texts listed here and has a slightly light hearted bent here and there. The second is it's an amalgamation of work by other authors, an anthology of works concerning a specific topic of Irish mythology not directly attributable to Yeats. None the less it is an interesting read and worth a go if you fancy something a tad lighter than usual. Oh also do not mistake the mention of Faeries in the title to mean this is some children's book. Faeries in actual mythology are not the most pleasent of creatures if you believe the details concerning them, less Tinkerbell of the peadophilic depiction of Disneys Tinkerbell of Peter Pan, more an unknowable manifestation of nature. <br><br>Ok gentlemen, the hour grows late where I am so I will try pick up again tomorrow or Friday at the latest. I'll finish off the British isles and Western Europe in general then post some Nordic, Central European and maybe some Baltic and Russian folklore and history for good measure. If anyone has any further texts that might help bring one closer to their homelands, please do not hesitate to post, preservation of our culture and history is of the utmost importance.</div>

The truth is, the words are not my own, not truly. They are a culmination of all I have learned from not just from those that came before us in epochs past but from those of us still present, you, me, all of us. This Age of Misery, it has taken so much away from us, our sense of self, our Will, our futures. Too long we have watched each other fall into the black morass of what the parasite wishes us to feel, creeping dread and nihilism lapping at the shores of our spirits like a vile encroaching tide. No more. The bonds of brotherhood we forged in shared grief at the current state of our situation must be forged into something greater, something new. A beacon to push back the darkness at our steps. This is what I have chosen to do to help our people, to offer not merely to reinvigorate the worthy ideals our people once held but to gift back all that what was taken in it's greatest form. Our pride. Our Love. Our Will. Our Strength. This is my belief, this is my faith, this is what our forebears did and so we shall as well. Thusly I can never turn my back on any of our people for their fate is also mine, our blood and shared history is forever intertwined and to reject it is tantamount to severing a limb. The people of Europa, be they in the heartlands or in the colonies, are brothers and brothers do not abandon each other. We stand and fall together and I have no intention of letting us fall. We'll make it together.<br><br>On the topic of a book I had begun work on a PDF with some of the work i've posted in this thread (of which initially there were plans for two forms, one for those outside our sphere of understanding, a second more direct one for those within it) however after formating I was displeased with it, it felt too clerical, too soulless. I have opted to make it a full book you may be pleased to know with the initial version being a the more direct one with it's tone the same as all I have written here so far. It is in it's very early stages however and there is a significant amount of topics and concepts to look at before the work is complete. My plan is to seed it where I can but starting here first for it is where I find far fewer "external influences" and thusly can have more reliable opinions and feedback. Not to mention after the fall of the then federal agent infested 8chan boards and the lost /sig/ threads this board was not merely kind enough to welcome me in but to make me feel at home thusly I can think of no better place. This book is intended to be a gift for us all, an attempt to make a difference to all of us who are in this battle. I shall see it done come what may.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#76417">&gt;&gt;76417</a><br>I'm most glad your enjoying it. You are quite right in your analysis concerning the advent of the industrial revolution for whether meant for good or ill it inevitably allowed for the most destructive of tendencies to occur over time. It led to an age of plenty which ironically has become an age of nothingness, hollow distractions for hollow men. Soft men. It is no wonder the parasite has had such an easy time with so many of our kin with offering fun little toys for boys who didn't have to grow up, having no duty to kin or a greater sense of community or even a sense of destiny, only self gratification and the pretense of being an "individual" in a sterile and vacuous domain. They engineered it well. Unfortunately for them not well enough.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#76818">&gt;&gt;76818</a><br>I am still here, I got waylaid due to some minor issues over the weekend which limited file access. Normal service will resume tomorrow, as way of an apology for the delay i'll dig through my old hard drive and include a copy of the Race Life of the Aryan Peoples (1907) by Joseph P. Widney, both volumes of course. I think you'll enjoy.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Man of my word. Race Life of the Aryan people and as for finishing off where we left off, here we go. Please note I intend to try limit my comments on the books for between one and two sentences as I could talk for hours on them and I don't wish to bore you or spoil them. <br><br>- Celtic folklore cont.<br><br>Finally onto the Welsh. Again, I reiterate, while there are some connections between the Welsh folklore and general Celtic folklore, Welsh does deviate a tad with a larger focus on hero figures. So to begin we will have a look at one of the most valuable yet overlooked pieces of Welsh history and folklore, the Red Book of Hergest (1911 release), one of what is known as the Four Ancient Books of Wales. It is a collection of Welsh poetry and literature from around the 15 century with the pieces supposedly reaching back as far as 9th century. A worthy read for any man of Welsh blood. I have included both the Welsh version and the English translation as a courtesy.<br><br>The second book of Welsh culture and lore I chose is not the Arthuriad (the tale of King Arthur, I've included a copy as well) but rather the Black Book of Carmarthen. Now don't let it's ominous name fool you, it refers to it's original binding, in an ironic twist it speaks of the ancient Heroes of Welsh folklore beyond the widely recognised Arthur and Merlin (although interestingly this book contains references to both that pre date the work of Jeffrey of Monmouth who is known as the man who bought them to public light in the Dark Ages). This again is another of the Four Ancient books of Wales, I merely narrowed down the two that I think will interest people the most. Version uploaded is a single version with both Welsh and English text, I could not locate language specific copies separately.<br><br>French Folklore;<br><br>Again, we have an odd situation akin to the British, that of Breton and Gaul folklore's differentiating although in a slightly different way, in this case the Gaul staying true to the Celtic tradition, the Breton to the Christian. There is also the Frankish which focuses around the legendary Charlemagne and the Normans who held the Viking traditions. For the sake of efficiency I shall include the French folklore under the Celtic due to the rich connections but also throw in a single curve ball of specific French folklore in the form of a French/Christian piece of importance.<br><br>Now sadly my knowledge on French Gaelic folklore is sadly lacking, I have some rudimentary knowledge of the songs of the Troubadours and quite enjoy their epic poetry but I fear much is lost in translation to me. With my knowledge lacking I none the less two pieces I am somewhat familiar with, if someone can attest to superior suggestions, as usual, please do not hesitate to offer. Firstly we have Folk Tales of Brittany by Lewis Spence (1917). As it's name suggests it speaks of the tales from the Brittany region. While an observant reader will note the similarity of some of the folk tales to those of the British Isles, it has two key differences. The first is the observation through a more continental lens, the second, some quite unique folklore with intriguing implications such as the "Ankou", a female death spirit. Intriguing indeed, a worthwhile read.<br><br>The second book I was torn on so I decided to hedge my bets and go for an epic tale, that of Legends of Charlemagne by Thomas Bulfinch (1863) which tells the saga of, you guessed it, Charlemagne. While yes this can be considered a Christian text to a degree it does not take the beauty and grandeur of this tale away. If you have a single drop of French blood I implore you to read and enjoy.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Including Welsh language version of the Red Book here also.<br><br>- English folklore<br><br>Now you may be wondering why I used the term English folklore and not say Anglo Saxon or some other term. Well, the reason is quite simple; the folklore of England isn't one single lineage. Allow me to explain. In England there are unique areas with unique heritages that actually contain very specific folklore to those people. An example would be Cornish folklore, which has more in common with Celtic rather than Saxon, same with the Manx from the Isle of Mann, they have a more Nordic folk heritage. Now were I to focus on a book for each different group, well that would take far too long so in it's place I will offer two general folk lore books and if requested will upload ones for region specific folklore.<br><br>So the first is one dear to my heart, Hero-Myths and Legends of the British Race. Now this book specifically is not entirely about the English nor British people overall but offers a collections of stories that quite accurately demonstrate the building blocks of the construction of English folklore. It contains tales ranging from the classic Beowulf to Ser Gerwain from Arthurian legend and Lady Cathleen, an Irish maiden who offered her soul to alleviate her peoples suffering. It all makes for quite an interesting read and goes some way to demonstrating the intermingling of Northern European folk tales on this little island. <br><br>The second book is an interesting one, I had considered going for Histories of the Kings of Britain by Geoffry of Monmouth but in it's place I think many a man seeking to reconnect with *true* England, not the squalid pit we are now, would appreciate A Book of Old English Ballads (1896). It sounds an odd choice does it not? Ah, but dear friends, it is in these ballads you get a real sense of the true English. The language is in fact not the old Anglo Saxon English but Middle English, old by current standards but still very accessible. It contains songs concerning the England/Scotland skirmishes, Robin Hood and one particular one I think many here will enjoy, the ballad of Hugh of Lincoln. I won't tell you why as that would ruin it, but needless to say it will definitely appeal. <br><br>Now, using the English fusion of Celtic and Nordic folklore we shall springboard to the North.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">- Nordic folklore;<br><br>This, this was a truly tricky beast. While it is helpful many of the Nordic nations share common tales, tradition and histories, what makes it difficult is deciding which texts to go with. There are so many interpretations, so many tales, it's a challenge. In fact I actually developed a headache finalising the choices. I could go for the fairly commonly recognised Poetic Edda but it's quite well known, I want to offer something refreshing. So, in place of an academic text looking at these topics, lets go for something a tad more enjoyable, The Volsunga Saga (1888). This is a retelling of the commonly recognised Poetic Edda as mentioned previously but presented in a more pleasing form. Battles, Gods, heroes and glory. A man could ask for little more. The Icelandic translator assisted the writer in capturing the feel of the texts and created a truly enjoyable journey. Give it a read, you'll enjoy it. As a supplement to this text I am also including a copy of Havamal (translated means Sayings of H√°r or Sayings of the High One), a poem from the Poetic Edda itself, it can serve as almost a kind of manual to living a decent life, it's an intriguing piece. The translation is adequate overall.<br><br>Hm, now that I think about it I'll include Tuetonic Myth and Legend as an alternative to the above suggestion of The Volsunga Saga, it's a complete retelling of the Nordic mythology cycle and includes a few other bits including some bits of Medieval tales, it's a pretty solid companion piece that helps tie a lot of European mythology together.<br><br>And the final book of the night, The Life and Death of Cormac the Skald. One of the Icelandic Sagas, this is assumed to be based upon one lost in the 12th century. This particular book is of a more scholarly bent which I hope won't put people off as I did place multiple Nordic books concerning the greatest of lore and tradition. The PDF in question contains a significant amount of the poetry of this lost it is also essentially an analysis as well discussing Cormac himself.<br><br>Now, where would people like me to go next, what heritages would you enjoy. Or failing that if you have other texts or suggestions for books that would help bring people closer to their kin fire out a suggestion, the tales of our people are one of the most important resources we have.</div>

The most relevant parts to us are the studies on Nords and Celts he did in an isolated valley in Switzerland and in an island off the Scottish highlands respectively. He describes society like it was naturally meant to be.

Apart from the one or two truly independent vineyards, most of them are owned by "wine families", which are usually just the renamed families of the Australian Jews like Sidney Myer and John Monash.<br>These Jews, BTW, are a lot more conspicuous than in America. John Monash was a Jew general in WWI famous for doing shit in Paschendale and is the only kosher general we're allowed to learn about. Sidney Myer started the country's most popular department store and has pretty much everything in Melbourne named after him due to his charitable deeds towards stuff like universities and orchestras.<br>Both of these Jews have 1/3rd of Melbourne (each) named after them, the rest being named after the British royal family of the past and present.</div>

Your mind subconsiously is thinking "out of all these people who am I to command or advise or speak to them?" However, if you just remember and think about the fact that you know more or are more capable in the matter that you are discussing than anyone else present than it helps with those feelings. I am young and a student and I teach as a student instructor and I can say that starting out it was the most difficult obstacle I had to overcome. But eventually I realized that I knew so much more about the subject than any of the students and so even if I made an occasional error, they wouldn't be any wiser. Knowing this has helped me overcome my fears when speaking to a large audience; hopefully it can be some use to you as well.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#76966">&gt;&gt;76966</a><br>I think the trick to reconnecting beyond folklore to how they lived is to dig widely. Now this is a tricky beast as the key to all of it is to look at texts prior to the beginning of the nations more noticeable subversion in it's culture (best bet being pre 20th century texts for the cleanest, unsullied view). A good book that covers a vast amount of European cultures is Hammerton's Manners &amp; Customs of Mankind, a book I've been slowly trying to make a PDF of (however the binding is giving out each session so I'm a bit wary unless I can find a second set). Now it does look at *all* cultures worldwide however the writer in question treats them as a sane man would; criticise where appropriate such as the barbarity of the African tribes, or show intrigue at the Asiatic people's honour codes. This book is a fantastic record of our traditions and the reasoning behind them such as the purpose of the "May Queen" and such local events to even a good section on the national dances of European nations and other such things that we had as part of our communities and the connections within them at large. It's not *too* hard finding a copy nowadays but digital ones do not exist apparently. <br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://ww">https://ww</a> w.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=hammerton&amp;tn=manners%20customs%20mankind&amp;cm_sp=mbc-_-ats-_-all<br><br>Now if you do go hunting this book, a word of warning. There are two main releases, one is a four volume, one is a three volume. The three volume is the one you want, it has larger page size and clearer images. The three volume has a "bad optics" as certain groups may consider it though, if it's pre 1930's it likely has a swastika on the spine as it concerns life and that is quite literally the symbol of it. There are some versions of the three volume without it but Hammerton's releases had a tendency to be erratic in their styling and how condensed down the work was meaning you could buy a three volume set to find out it's actually a four set with a book missing. It's a shame as they put out some good work. If looking for it, check it's dimensions, you want a full size copy, not the smaller editions.<br><br>Now when it comes to a general search for good books concerning our peoples lives, trick I use is to search for cultural history with antique book sellers and such. Look for online used book stores that have the ability to search for those criteria, antique books and cultural history (a search for anthropology texts can also yield some luck as well). Of course, you'll get the usual drivel of "Oh look, there's this delightful tribe of negroes who partake in cannibalism, thats lovely" by Moishe Levi or some such but careful hunting will reveal some excellent texts. For instance, you mention diets and such, well you may be interested in texts recording cooking to gain an insight into our ancestors diets. I'll offer an example in fact, Anglo-saxon Food &amp; Drink (hold back the giggles, it's far more hearty than the semite have most believe) which offers decent insight on food from fifth to eleventh century. It is a more modern release yes but for the most part it functions as what it is; an insight into how we ate prior to high sugar consumption.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Now, as you rightly point out concerning our general life style before this modern "all hail the individual" mentality, we always had roots over the land and a good way to both understand and learn more about them is to look at releases in the very early 20th century and 19th (any earlier will always be prohibitively expensive and rare) that cover our older histories with a general overview. For example, A Short History of Ireland from the earliest times to 1608 (yes that is it's full title) contains not only Ireland's history but early laws, how the "classes" of previous eras related and operated and how we functioned as a community or small kingdom and the lifestyle of those within it. Here's an excerpt;<br><br><span class="greenText">&gt;In theory the land belonged not to individuals, but to the tribe. The king or chief had a portion assigned to him as mensal land. The rest was occupied by the tribesmen in the several ways mentioned below. The chief, though exercising a sort of supervision over the whole of 'the territory, had no right of ownership except over his own property, if he had any, and for the time being over his mensal land.</span><br><br>I've included a copy of this text as well in the post, it's not a far fetch to consider this state of affairs would be repeated in a multitude of European nations as well in previous periods, most followed similar models of societal evolution with deviations occurring due to outside factors such as significant wars that claimed territory, overt vassalisations or the use of ursery by the parasite. Now bear in mind if you look at English language texts on other nations histories and peoples you should always consider the author in question and their connections *to* that particular land. For instance, the reason I chose the books previously is because in most of the cases it is written by men *of* that particular land, who have an intrinsic link to the blood and soil of it or worked very closely with the translation. They should always be first and foremost in your list of choices when seeking literature on a particular group within our grand brotherhood.<br><br>However if your looking to know the people themselves and how they saw their lives in the day to day rather than a macro level, there's two distinct avenues, that of their poetry and that of their folk songs (I divide them into two for poetry is always more prosaic or pedantic on occasion where as folk songs are always more direct). For instance, you can get a good picture of the greater skein of a peoples feelings on significant events through poetry, the lesser known poets of a nation can be a good source for more interesting viewpoints where their folk songs can tell you of a day to day feeling. An example of this is Dominion of the Sword, a ballad of English Cavaliers which can be sourced from The Loyal Garland (1686 with reprinting in 19th century) (no PDF available). It is quite revealing in it's lyrics of the time they lived in and their perspective. For instance;<br><br><span class="greenText">&gt; This fits a Lay-man to preach and pray man,</span><br>'Tis this can make a Lord of him that was a Drayman;<br>Forth from the dull pit, of Follies full pit,<br>This brought an Hebrew Iron-monger to the Pulpit;<br>Such pittifull things be, more happier than Kings be,<br>This got the Herauldry of Thimblebee and Slingsbee;<br>No Gospel can guide it, no Law can decide it,<br>In Church or State, untill the Sword hath sanctify'd it. <br><br>Full lyrics here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://ww">https://ww</a> w.musicanet.org/robokopp/english/laybyyou.htm<br><br>Now this is but one example, there are countless ones for each nation with each one bringing you closer to how they lived. The music of a people is akin to the heart of a people.</div>

Concerning my writing style it is influenced from a few things, mainly an appreciation for men passionate about their language and an emulation of it to my best of my ability which can be tricky in English compared to say German which has a more artistic temperament with it's verbal versatility (example of this is words such as gestalt and schadenfreude) but I try to evoke what I feel in my text through whatever way I can.<br><br><span class="greenText">&gt;So I would also recommend you to work on your stylometry?

Relocating this year also helped alleviate my fears a tad.<br><br>I like others fought through the crippling nihilism, the incandescent rage at the treachery of those who were meant to secure out future and the confusion of what action to take in the face of it all which led me to make one simple conclusion; if we are to survive we must unite under one banner. A banner of strength, of not merely a vague hope but of something substantial, that of a belief in ourselves and our people, a banner that grants them the resolve they need to stand against what comes. My writing style I keep the same as I believe those who understand the situation deserve a greater level of respect and communication than the usual light footed words of the "intellectual elite" or the simpleton observations of a groyper type for words, if they are to have real meaning, must be spoken from a place of passion be it from love or animosity. No doubt one day I will have to sink back into the noise, cease these posts and become just a footnote as so many others have. But until that time there is work to be done, there is messages to send to brothers standing upon the precipice of self destruction or already lost in the ruination of this epoch.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Welcome once more dear friends, today's topic is a topic that seems to be of interest for a number of gentlemen so thusly we shall endeavour to take a closer look at one of the more degenerative issues facing our people; the subject of pornographic material. <br><br>Pornography. One of the most corrosive things for a man's well being yet so blindly sought after by so many. It is of no surprise of course, be it PornHub, XHamster or countless other examples, pornography is both pervasive and of course free. How does the old adage of questionable origin go, "The best things in life are free"? Hm, yes, quite. One shouldn't struggle or strive for the things they desire and invest time and effort, only the *best* things such as porn are free. One does wonder why. Well we shall soon see, but first we must understand the fundamental issue with not merely pornography but a great many modern poisons. <br><br>Consider for a moment the word tolerance. It's a deceptively simple word is it not, seemingly innocuous yet somehow one that hides a great deal of malice behind it's use. Be "tolerant" of the invader, be "tolerant" of the mentally ill mutilating themselves, be "tolerant" of the parasite for all these things mentioned will "lift" your grey life and bring such vibrancy to the world, you merely need be "tolerant". Such subtle machinations. When one imbibes a large dose of poison or drug, does the body not act intolerantly to it for it is trying to restore itself to a state of normalcy as it fights against this sudden onslaught. Ah but my friends consider this, what if the poison is introduced slowly, what if with each sip from the poisoned chalice of this modern age your body involuntary builds a tolerance to it, what then. Well the dose is increased is it not, increased as the body grows accepting of it's effects. Take an alcoholic for example. At the start that three glasses of beer was enough and then in order to feel it's inebriating effects the dose must be increased, four, five, six, entire bottles of spirits for as the effect of the alcohol dulls the alcoholic must increase the dosage. So what happens in the end. Death. The body shuts down, organs begin to fail as the addiction has ran it's course and all that is left is a body rotting from the inside out. *This* is the modus operandi of the semite and the poisons it peddles, of which porn has been a key one.<br><br>Ponder for a moment if you are a man addicted to porn. What was your first hit. Was it a blurry image that took ten minutes to load on a 56k modem? Was it the cover of a pornographic magazine that sits upon the top shelf of a rack in a corner shop/convenience store. Mayhaps it was something as simple as a partially exposed breast in a movie that you rewound to watch again and again. Now this on it's own, it is of little consequence. But what of all the thousands of other "small" instances that follow this. Seeing a woman dressed as a whore on a shopping trip out with your parents as a child, putting on a children's TV show where suddenly the animated females within it all have significant breasts and sexualised physiques. A music video (or Youtube video if referencing this current time) where the video itself is sold using bare flesh and suggestive ideas. A common argument you will hear defending this is that a child becoming a man must awaken to his sexual needs at some point or another must he not, and they are quite right, a part of manhood is understanding what is desirable in a potential mate.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">The problem emerges when he is led to believe that there is a better alternative to trying to find a woman to satisfy his needs and to find a bond with, that there is an ample abundance of not just easy access alternatives to what he desires most in his hormone driven dilemma but material that supercedes a normal woman, material to replace this drive with things he had not considered or would ever be introduced to in a normal, healthy society, new acts he had not been aware of. So much like the alcoholic he maybe dabbled once or twice a week, sneaking quiet periods to glimpse at these new acts in solitude. But slowly the resistance to it grows, slowly the man will become bored and want to see something new, something more depraved and down the rabbit hole he goes, every side link on the page introducing him to more and more degenerative and repulsive content. Bizarre sex acts involving unpleasant devices, the drive to fill an anal cavity with your semen despite the clear disgusting risks to both you and the woman, a need to watch women degrade themselves and in some cases see the man degraded in cuckold fetish porn, the list is unending and gratuitous. But what is the final result of this, is it the beginning of an organ shutdown, is it a slow death as you just continue to imbide all that poisons? In a manner of speaking.<br><br>You see, this "tolerance" that is built, it does not build within a specific organ but within the mind initially. You begin to find "normal" sex boring, it lacks the excitement, the interest of the more debauched things that you were already offered holds precedent resulting in a lack of function for your genitals, you struggle to reach a peak level. You will find it harder to get aroused at a normal female if all she will offer is "regular" sex, not something to fulfill your "kinks" (unless you intend to seek a broken whore, in which case you are destroying your life even more so by bonding with such a foul creature not to mention inviting in a slew of delightful sexually transmitted diseases). Your mind has become rewired, it has been repurposed to consume more and more of the very thing that is breaking apart your sexual understanding, it has warped them from the pleasure of procreation to pleasure in the taboo and the abominable. It corrupts at a fundamental level. Some may try and use semetic arguments around this, that to deny pleasure is to deny life but I am afraid such pathetic argumentation holds little weight. It is of little wonder the French aristocracy suffered the fate it did with the likes of the Marquis de Sade running around raping children to fill his disgusting lusts for that is the inevitable result of such argumentation in favour of this chain of thought, the evidence is clear to see even through semetic obfuscation.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Some of the modern (((right))) and (((centrists))) will argue in favour of a balanced approach, that the "slippery slope" is a mere fallacy while for instance discreetly avoiding mentioning the acts of those partaking in sexual reassignment surgery and the butchers bill that entails to turn a man or woman into a stitched together creature whom is still what they were born, the only difference being their genitals are now maliciously carved into simulacrums of what they "sexually" identify as. Some may even cite this as a needed "freedom" regardless of cost to our people as a whole, that the individual has the right to act as they please forgetting always that mental illness is indeed a danger to the individual and the group as a whole. These self same people also forget when considering pornography that to produce it requires individuals to denigrate themselves in order to make it, turning them from kin to something barely above animalistic and enticing others to join them in their acts. There can be no half measures concerning porn and degeneracy, no middle ground, it is too corrosive a substance to allow for for we have seen the results of such thinking not just in our current Age of Misery but in epochs past such as the bath houses of dying Rome or the Sodomy within the time of stagnating of ancient Greece. <br><br>Consider that this is by no means a modern disease although it is far more prevalent now thanks to the semites deployment of it as weapon, their skill in debasing a people is truly... let us say "unique". It acts as a multi prong attack, first it is as a lure to the unsuspecting, luring the unaware into enjoying pornography with offers of pleasure and endless lust, this is then followed up with a slow poisoning of the mind as he builds tolerance to the types of porn he has already consumed until the man in question cannot interact sexually with a female on a normal level with degenerative sex acts becoming an addiction in place of it thus making him unable to function with them, he becomes something that is almost akin to a eunuch as a result for he is useless with the opposite gender. Normalcy cannot satisfy him, only depravity will. The semite takes significant pleasure in these actions, after all over 98% of the porn industry is ran by those of the tribe, it is an enjoyable business for them on multiple levels when you consider it all. They get to watch white women get defiled by negroes on regular occasions for they greatly enjoy debasing of the cattle, they get to take money from those same targets either through direct pay sites, sponsorship's or advertising and they get to put a halt to the population growth of the target nations. Throw in their open admittance to finding pleasure in the targeting of Christians with this market (I am not a Christian myself but this is worth mentioning for Christians reading as it's well documented) and you have the full image of the purpose of pornography by and large. By the end of it all, you will no longer be a man, just a puppet to lust and to you women will no longer be women, just a tool to fulfill these desires, not a mother to your child, not a love that reminds you of of what were fighting for, she is now just a hole you need to fill. I mean consider for a moment, in most pornography you are watching some other man have sex and do countless other acts upon a woman, it is not you in that act, it is him, you are a bystander, it is a form of almost selling cuckoldry when you consider this aspect. You may try and do mental gymnastics about this act as claiming "well I'm imagining that I'm him" but regardless you are at the end of the day still watching another man plow another woman who is in essense now just a mere piece of moaning meat. It's subconscious cuckoldry even if you try deny it. This is what you must overcome.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">So now we come to the key question, how does one escape the clutches of this addiction, of this self inflicted degradation. The first thing to do is understand it's purpose is not to alleviate sexual desires but to instead poison them, it is destroying you on a level you may not fully comprehend. Much like an alcoholic who does not know his drunken anger is causing harm to those around him, you yourself are causing harm to those who might one day call you their love for you will not be able to grasp how to be with them on both an emotional and sexual plain. You must cease making false excuses up for this action, it is not a need, you do not die without pornography, it is an addiction and must be treated as such, it's damage may not be quite as visual as others but it is so very present none the less. Upon understanding this you gain the first layer of defense against the parasites predations. Pornography's goal is to draw you in, it is to tempt you back into descending into depravity. It is only with a steeled Will you will resist it, a Will you must learn to build. A man suffering from a constant "need" to satisfy will usually do so under specific circumstances or times, be it just before bed, a day off or in a brief window where he is free from duties. You must place something else within these windows of time to break the routine. Books, music or some other form of distraction in those periods can help a great deal, meditation if you feel capable of it can also offer a good alternative but I shan't harp on about that as it's a subject commonly discussed. <br><br>The same applies if you encounter something that triggers an aroused response, you must acquire control over this urge with refocusing on other aspects of import. Some favour a method of association, for instance if a man is addicted but values hygiene, a simple mental comment of "imagine the smell", while being somewhat of a meme, will illicit a disgust reaction as an example, such an exercise may be of use but be careful of what associations you use lest they backfire and repulse you from procreation and women completely or lead you to the pathetic MGTOW or incel and inevitably to oblivion. Speaking of the pathetic and weak look upon that recent "coomer" meme, is it not the ultimate expression of nihilism much like the clown world meme? It is an acceptance of the status quo, an acceptance of all that poisons with the nihilistic reaction of "lol clownworld" or "lol cooming". So what if your being broken down mentally through degradation, so what if your women and children are targeted to be defiled, so what if your future looks bleak, can't change it right? Lets just go jerk off and moan. Utterly pathetic. We control our own fates, our own futures. We decide it. We must reject all the darkness of this age wholesale and stand together as Men, as sons of Europa where ever we may be. Never surrender to the cowardice of nihilism or degeneration.<br><br>To conclude you must realise there is no magical way to break pornographies grip without you choosing to do so and do so you must. You hold greater value than you believe for would the semite work so hard to defile both ourselves and our women were we not a threat, if they did not fear us would they be so angered by the very concept of our rejecting of degeneracy? You must choose to rise above the poisoned waters and the degeneracy, you must choose to walk with your brothers against the nightmare of this time. Those of us by your side, we can help you to your feet and fight with you but you must raise your own arm in defiance as well for we can only carry you so far. Together we will make it but only if you choose to reject all that weakens you, that turns you into a slave to their machinations.</div>

They really did grow desperate with their libels when they thought these up, didn't they also claim something with an eagle and a bear at some point too, I have a vague recollection of something to that effect.<br><br>As it's tangentially related to hygiene and some of our brothers may struggle in knowledge of that area of /sig/ I'll offer what I know. Firstly, the less added chemicals the better. A touch of fragrance is perfectly suitable but the key to finding a good soap that isn't filled with cheap chemicals is to look at "organic" soaps. Yes, I find these labels quite frustrating too, I hear organic and my mind immediately thinks an unwashed degenerate sitting in a field with a drum pretending to "get back to nature" but it's more than that. By opting for something with simpler ingredients you can sidestep a number of potential issues such as exacerbating eczema, oily skin, dry skin and so forth. Now such a thing does not always have to be expensive, some can actually be rather cheap and work a charm. I would say a good day to day one for showering and cleansing is olive oil soap, most are made using simply olives, water and minerals, it's quite effective and usually has no scent but even if it has a few more than just the base above as long as it says naturally sourced you are mostly good to go. As a general rule when it comes to looking for something of this nature pay no more than ¬£2.00 ($2.50) if it's for general use. You do not need something artisinal or "hoity toity" as they say, you merely need something functional and moderately pleasant, a bar of decent soap should last somewhere between two weeks to a month at most. If wishing for a scented one you should especially look for organic, having real lavender in place of that cheap chemical facsimile of it is vital, chemical copies of scents often have detrimental effects to skin due to the base they'll use. Basically you want the fewest ingredients possible in a bar of soap, check where it's sourced from (Israel is a keen peddler of these kind of things internationally thusly helping their economy would be unwise) and make sure your not paying ridiculous prices for something that is quite cheap to make. <br><br>Oh a useful side tip is to remember a good lather with a bar of soap is usually superior to shave with than shaving foam, just remember to make sure you have a good warm rinse after to remove any left over soap from your follicles. It'll improve your complexion also, people often forget shaving foam too is usually a combination of slurry such as potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. Compare that to a simple lather of just real soap and you'll notice the difference after a few weeks, your skin will be less tired looking and it can also help a tad with razor burns if your prone to such things. <br><br>The golden rule is; if it's readily available, cheap and had tons of extra chemicals thrown in, nine times out of ten there is a Berg, Stein or Gold at the head of this company ensuring that it is "goyimfeed" being made available for the parasites host nation. If they back something it's usually poor for you. Always look for how things operated pre parasite influence and make well educated conclusions on things from there, this includes simple aspects such as hygiene and those selling the items for it.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">I apologise for my absense of late, with Yuletide nearing I have found my time somewhat limited. Tonight I return once more with a subject of interest; Upon the topic of Power.<br><br>Power is a mercurial thing is it not. It can be turned from a solid, immovable thing to a viscous gel slipping through ones grip. It's a subject our opponents are most familiar with, their power not in the traditional European form of strength of Will or noble ideals but rather in the manipulative forms of finance and scheming. A clear cut opponent to the ideals of the European peoples principle of power. Our leaders, our weak and pathetic leaders, fell one by one to their machinations, lust for personal gain overriding their duties thusly allowing for the gravest of insults to the sons and daughters of Europa to occur without real resistance, that of ursery and indirect slavery. What happens when one rejects these notions of greed and lust, well look no further than the Men who stood against them in the 1930's, look upon the ashes left and tell me what you see. A betrayal, possibly the greatest betrayal in the history of our people. This is how odious, how manipulative the parasite is with it's power. It's a stark realisation is it not. GDP is more important than a nations native people. Trade is more important than protecting them. How very semetic the world has become.<br><br>The parasite exercises power in a way only they can, to turn the world as gray and disgusting as themselves. To denigrate and shackle the spirit to the mundane and the horrific. A truly vile state of affairs has emerged under their disgusting ideals, a state of affairs we must together fix. This is why we must not merely fight to gain power but understand the methodology behind it. Yes, finance and information, both are power in one form but they are power on the purely material level, within the realm of the European spirit there is a far greater power, a far more effective power. That of the power of the Will. Now this is a subject I have spoken on in earlier posts but in this post I shall endeavour to explain it's greater purpose and how to utilise it to maximum effect.<br><br>First we must start by dispelling the notion that "Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely". This is one of the greatest lies the parasite has ever shared for it *holds* power, it pushes this concept for it's own gain. Do not seek power cattle for power is unjust, only the evil seek power, it must be shared, not guided by an individual with noble ideals and vision for his own, share it with us instead goyim should you get it. It is not power that corrupts, it merely amplifies the corruption within the wielder themselves. Throughout the history of our people, those who rejected the parasite but held power proved the lie of this claim of power corrupting. Be it the resistance to Jewish capital in the 1930's Germany under Hitler, the leaders of the Goth tribes in Germania, the Men of the Scythian and Aryan migrations, Men like Mosley, Mousillini and Rockwell, these individuals all held incredible power, a power to speak to the spirit of their peoples and to use it wisely. It is only when power is taken by those with darker tendencies and weaknesses that power itself becomes a danger. Does anyone think it is any surprise in this Age of Misery that those in the high halls of politics and industry all share the same disgusting attributes and goals, is it any wonder these vile creatures all attend the same social circles and have the same degenerate tendencies as they covet more and more influence with other degenerated brethren.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Oh, the semite will tell you "But goyim, if you wish to succeed in *our* system you need to be like that, you need to be a sadistic animal". Yes, in *their* system you do. But *we* are not the semite. We are not the parasite who leaches upon the lifeblood of others. Our power, our innate power does not come from strength of finance or the power to twist truths to our own ends for we are above such sickening and psychopathic tendencies no matter how far they try to drive our spirits and our cultures down. The European people, for all the semites attempts to hide such notions, have a sense of justice within themselves. This is a natural state for our people, one that spurred revolutions for both good and ill, one that is now hijacked for the semites own goals in the form of "Social Justice" and it's various other degenerative ideals. This is an exercise of their power, an effective one yes but one limited. Consider for a moment friends, consider just how much they control. Finance. Media. Government. Countless forces that are arrayed against us. Yet here we still stand, here we still rally against these hateful creatures despite all they have, all by an act of Will. It is a demonstration their power is not absolute, even after centuries of ursery and political manipulations. There is something fundamentally vital to the European people, an energy that even when coerced into something that harms themselves is still there even when buried in a corrupted form. It is this sense of justice when utilised right that can be an unshakeable conviction against their predations.<br><br>So just what is Will. When I speak of Will I do not mean some intangible concept of esoteric origin. No, what I refer to is allowing the spirit to just take action. Instead of hesitation it is Will that drives you forward with a "No I will not capitulate and drink your poison lies". "No I will not just die". "No I will not surrender my people". Will is the force that propels one onwards, it's effect sharpened by strength both physical and mental and it's direction guided by knowledge and wisdom. It is what turns a man into someone noteworthy, what makes a layabout coward into a Man of Action. But there is something one should note here. Not every man can become a Man. Most of our people, they are vulnerable in a way, they are simple and require guidance from Men. They enjoy the simple things, a cold beer, a sports game of some sort and to be left alone. Simple things for simple men. If we lived in an age where poisoned lies were not whispered into their ears, if they were not deluged by false realities where the negroid and the arab are "just like you" this may not of be too much concern but as it stands it is an issue, their lives even if simple could be led to a greater purpose than they realise by true Men of Action had this not been the case. We must understand in turn it is not the masses that need to learn of how to become better but you, you who have found this thread, you who see the poison within our people and wish to purge it and take back our future. The men who sit at home wishing for simple, they will follow you one day in example, whether it be a single friend or an entire nation, by demonstrating you have the Will to be something more they will follow you seeking guidance. This *is* our power. No not all of us can become the embodiment of the European spirit, we all will have places we are lacking in one form or another but it is vital we all understand the power of Will none the less for this is a power the semite does not have. There is a quote from Goebbels that rings so true to this.<br><br>"Good propaganda does not need to lie, indeed it may not lie. It has no reason to fear the truth. It is a mistake to believe that people cannot take the truth. They can. It is only a matter of presenting the truth to people in a way that they will be able to understand. A propaganda that lies proves that it has a bad cause. It cannot be successful in the long run."</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Think on what he said here for a moment, just consider. He says that you not merely need not lie but you may not lie which speaks to truth as an objective idea, not the semetic ideals of subjective where all manner of falsehoods can be offered to cover ones vile trails. Truth is truth. This is a fundamental tenant of the European concept of justice. This is the essense of manifested power we have, not merely to form our knowledge into propaganda as Goebbels did but to lead men with positive aspects within it by demonstrating an unwavering stance upon these truths. The phrase "The truth shall set you free" comes to mind when thinking upon this for in a way it will. When one accepts the truth of a situation he must become determined to do what must be done in one form or another to resolve it. If a man sees the ethnic replacement of his nation, for a time he may try make excuses, try to hide from it, ignore it to the best of his limited abilities. But when he accepts this is a truth, when he accepts that something must be done, Will begins to manifest. <br><br>He must accept whole heartedly that he must be the emobodiment of change and build a resistance to the lies of the parasite for their goal is to sap this Will so he will not resist. "Oh our people will be a minority in the States by 2040 or even 2030, yolo fuck it time for porn" will be the implanted suggestion within a number of circles, a very deliberate acceptance of the lies pushed by the semite that there is nothing that can be done. It is your Will that allows you to not merely resist these lies but to counter them with reminding brothers of the strength, dignity and achievements of our people. Share your Will with them by reminding them of not merely what is at stake but just how they can defeat the enemy even in the most simplest of ways. Each Man must choose his own method, be it a brutal frontal dispelling of lies or the implantation of our own concepts of battle in this struggle. Will is simply you manifesting nobler principles into reality without hesitation and giving others guidance on how to do the same to a degree they feel capable of.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Now one may look at this concept and try to simplify it, try to claim "oh this is just the power of positive thinking" but this goes a tad deeper than that. Positive thinking is helpful yes but it can also offer a crutch. It allows for excuses such as accepting failure when there is no room for it for accepting defeat gracefully is oblivion when concerning our people. Will is something beyond this simple idea of "positivity". It is a certainty. A certainty that you *must* do what you can for your people no matter how small. That you *will* do it for no one else can, no one else is strong enough to bear the burden of knowledge upon you, that in place of self pity or nihilism you rise above and lift your brothers up with you no matter the cost. It is the culmination of the idea that no one is coming to save us therefore we must save ourselves. It must be built up bit by bit yes for in this epoch the darkness looms over like a diseased miasma but once built is becomes unassailable. <br><br>Your spirit becomes unbreakable for you have faith in something greater, you see a greater purpose, a greater goal than the simple and the mundane the semite wishes you to have. It is a drive for greatness in yourself and in your brothers. This is an idea that must be restored to us if we are to succeed, the idea that things surpass the common ideals of commerce and materialism and require us to share the strength and resources we have with our brothers in whatever form we can offer. The semite will never allow us access to funds to deploy against them, they will never allow us a moment in the public square unless they firmly control it. But enough Men with the Will to not merely lead but to offer them faith in a future as things collapse is a far more powerful weapon than what they possess. A Man with strength of Will is a man without a price. It is a man who cannot be broken by petty wordplay or pathetic machinations. This is who we are. This is who we will be. I know this can be done for I myself have did it as have others. We have the power to make change, no matter how small, individually. But if we rally others to us and open the way for others to build upon our ideals, if we show the power of our Will and how they themselves can achieve what we have then we have the tool to break the parasite in a way it fears most; an indomitable force they cannot coerce nor manipulate. An arrow to the heart of the beast.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#77323">&gt;&gt;77323</a><br>Decent words yet again. You bring a rare quality to this board. <br><span class="greenText">&gt;Instead of hesitation it is Will that drives you forward with a "No I will not capitulate and drink your poison lies". "No I will not just die". "No I will not surrender my people". </span><br>And the mind-slaves of the enemy reply with "You're so negatve. Why do you hate everything? Why not just accept the 'love'? White supremacist! Racist!" Bullshit and buzzwords. It's like the subject of doublespeak in another thread. Racism is in reality the desire to have entire cultures destroyed so that certain races (European) do not exist anymore, but jewish media brainwashing warps that reality. As Goebbels said, "One cannot defend himself against the jew. He attacks with lightning speed from his position of safety and uses his abilities to crush any attempt at defense. Quickly he turned the attacker's charges back on him, and the attacker becomes the liar, the troublemaker, the terrorist." Yet Goebbels, long after his life has ceased, has been frequently misquoted out of context, mostly construing that he was a liar, when he was in fact describing jews. It is just as he predicted. Meanwhile, "the master race" as Hitler described the jews as trying to achieve for their race, has been pinned falsely on the Third Reich. The jew always turned the attacker's charges back with falsehoods. It's an elaborate game of "no you!"<br><span class="greenText">&gt;"Good propaganda does not need to lie, indeed it may not lie." etc.</span><br>You would make a decent truth propaganda minister. Yet many are going to be needed to combat the enemy parasites infesting our nations. They have many ministers of lying propaganda.<br><span class="greenText">&gt;He must accept whole heartedly that he must be the embobodiment of change and build a resistance to the lies of the parasite</span><br>Exactly. Public shootings by lone wolves only empower the enemy kikes. They fear actual resistance by numbers, so do what they can break us up psychologically (the Freudian concept of honing jewish mind-games), even on a back-woods imageboard such as this with very little traffic.<br><span class="greenText">&gt;"Oh our people will be a minority in the States by 2040 or even 2030, yolo fuck it time for porn" will be the implanted suggestion within a number of circles</span><br><span class="greenText">&gt;a very deliberate acceptance of the lies pushed by the semite that there is nothing that can be done.</span><br>There are many more psy ops than that. This is why kikes are depicted with wringing hands: <strong>the jew mind is always scheming</strong>. For instance: Hitler and National Socialism are the deterrent. They figured out through "de-nazification" LYING propaganda how to turn stupid people away. Yet there remains those who still follow Hitler and the purity of the NSDAP. So, what the jew does is try to villify Hitler in the context of we who hate jews. They call him a jew, which is so obviously a lie. They call the NSDAP Zionists. They spread the traitor Otto Strasser's words, and since the Strasser brothers cooperated with Communists and kicked those out of their meetings who spoke "anti semitism", the attempt comes full circle to bring National Socialists to Communism. Even "gas the jews" is nonsense they spread, though gas was only effective against lice and gassing one individual at a time has only been proven possible in state executions in airtight chambers. Certainly not basements with flimsy wooden doors and glass panel windows. Absolutely not by incinerating 6 million between 42 and 45 in brick ovens behind modern crematoriums which can't even do that, while bicycling in between gassings. Such BS, but bullshit is the jews' game. It's wordplay through lies. They'll try to take us all through their Kabbalistic belief in words and numbers sorcery.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#77327">&gt;&gt;77327</a><br>I was in a rush to type that. I forgot to explain the true position against "You're so negative. Why do you hate everything? Why not just accept the 'love'?", which I'm sure we all know already is this - You're not negative for supporting your people. It's a positive. You do not hate everything, you hate the enemy parasite that hates you and wants you destroyed. You do accept love and should have endless love for your own people. Yet responding in this way to those typical knee-jerk outbursts of brainwashed imbeciles, I have found their minds shut down in Pavlovian response. Replies happen such as "whatever!" which is laughably never an argument or mere guttural noises. Sighing, grunting, pursing their lips to make farting noises. When a monkey is upset, it screeches just as they do, flings it's arms around, throws shit. It's sad how people reduce themselves to the behavior of primates when their jewish conditioning has been challenged.</div>

The semetic inversion of our morals has had a disastrous effect on our reasoning skills resulting in the rejection of all that is beautiful and the embrace all that is ugly. A horrific state of affairs. Where men once had bravery in their hearts they now have cowardice and misery. We must aim to change that, no matter the cost.<br><br>Tonight's topic will not be of the heady sort, no grand exposition on Will or strength but rather one that I hope will help during these winter months, a subject most prevalent for some. That of how to handle the feeling of isolation in winter.<br><br>During the long winter nights it can be a struggle sometimes can it not. As the sun waxes lower in the chilly skies it's quite easy for one to feel a sense of sorrow on the breeze, a sense of despair. Oh, many attribute it to SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) and such like or make some excuse but let us cut to the heart of the matter. The world in a way is quieter and lonelier in winter, isn't it. Not in a literal way but as a whole, the year is drawing to a close, the winter cold cuts deep into one as things seemingly begin to feel harder than usual. It's a familiar struggle each year isn't it, you feel time passing yet nothing changes, just a feeling of lethargy eats away at your soul as the days grow colder. Even things you do regularly, things you know you should do seem a struggle in this period. <br><br>It is of no surprise many feel this way for this is natures time of renewal, the crescendo of her decline before her rebirth during the Winter Solstice (the longest night of the year before the sun begins to return). In seasons past we had brothers to turn to, wives to lend us their strength, family to remind of us what is important and and a community in which we would feel a part of to lift our spirits and give us strength which in turn is partly why celebrations are held both on the Solstice and on Christmas Day for they are something we could all take part in as a community. While some do have these structures in one form or another many more do not. Many more stand alone or distant from those who could provide the succor they need, when combined with the burden of knowledge and duty those of our ilk carry, it is no wonder so many fall into misery or despair. It is a hard time made harder by the loss of all that once made us whole.<br><br>In the dark, lonely hours of the night when ones mind wanders to the darker places it is easy to feel despondent, the temptation to numb the pain either in an intoxicant or in an unrelenting resentment of the world is ever present. I know this because I knew that feeling intimately some years ago for a few winters, I believe it was likely my first "red pill" as it were. When I left the decrepit pit of my home city and found there was a real world where my people still lived truer, not the hyper reality of the media illusion, it was intoxicating. I felt at home at first if a tad alien. But as time passed and October began I began to lose that feeling. No matter who I spoke to, no matter what I did I could not fit in with those I lived around even though they were fellow countrymen. Where I locked my doors when I was still home they left their unlocked, when a local Christmas fair√© was on I'd only briefly visit but never socialise, every time I walked home in the early evening I'd still be looking over my shoulder or glancing down side roads for trouble.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">London hadn't just been a lie I had been living, it had been a leech, sucking away every last ounce of trust I had for my own people for I believed them to be just like the negroid or the third worlder. It stole from me something precious and in winter this horrific mindset became amplified and isolated me even more so into loneliness. When I lived in that city I had been distracted, a much simpler man entertained by much simpler things for that was what was to be expected, be it media consumption, alcohol or women, it was a hedonistic paradise for an empty vessel. Escaping it was liberating but I believed I had nothing to replace it with at the time and for nigh on five years each November onwards I would retreat inside myself, my gloom and misery overriding everything as I felt I was truly alone since leaving my old life. I overcame that through understanding the how and why of it all but that is something I shall come onto later. This is merely my story though, an example of how one can suffer through those months, we each have our own, our own paths we walk in this cold season where we feel alone. In a way we are alone, that is true. But we also are not. <br><br>As the parasite draws away the warmth of our spirits and drains the lifeblood of our people to fuel it's infernal mechanisms it is getting harder and harder to find comradery for where can we look? There is no single answer for this question but there are avenues to consider. A first port of call should be family. Now being the men we are we can often find it hard to communicate with our kin, their insistence at living within the dream world the parasite has enforced can be an exercise in patience but they are still your family none the less and in times of distress they can provide you the support you need. You need not unload all your burdens upon them, simply a phone call can be enough to remind you that you are not alone, that there is still someone who still cares about you. Be it a mother, father, sibling or even estranged kin, they can be a reminder that you mean something to someone and that is the most important thing to remember in these winding months. Failing family then friends can be a help although this again can be an even harder proposition than family for I have seen many a man become so insular he struggles to even find bonds of friendship and understandably so in this time where we are apostates against the degeneration of our nations. However if you do have bonds then a simple text message may be enough to lift the spirits but it is a poorer thing than sharing a drink or catching up over a meal so if possible go for that angle, if not, then go with simpler methods of indirect communication (that is not an excuse to skip out on building brotherhoods however, the enemy requires you to be lazy to be miserable, bear that in mind). The key is simply realise there is someone out there whoever they may be that genuinely cares.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Now the above solution is not a catch all, for some these are not options, either through their own choice or circumstances beyond their control some are isolated from the grim world fully. The ties that bind are gone and they are left adrift in this lonely time. To those of you who are, I ask you to do something. I ask that you remember you have a purpose beyond what the parasite would believe you have. In past posts I have spoken about all that has been taken from you, your past, your future, your kith and kin. They have taken so much. They would take your life too if you allow it. At winter when we are alone we are at our most vulnerable, easy pickings for the degenerative properties of this current epoch. We see no avenues of escape, the dream of a brighter tomorrow easily smothered when all that lays outside our door is a cold and bitter land with no one to keep us hopeful in the dark hours, no one to keep one warm at night. Our people survived the harsh winter nights not merely by intelligence but by our spirit as well, our shared bond with one another where when one found himself lost in misery a brother would lift him up so we would all survive as a people for that is what is required, that we stand together. This is how communities operated, how *we* operated as a people in times past. Some out of arrogance would attribute it to "Christian morality" but considering if one looks at history prior to Christianity it existed among us even then it instead becomes a statement that is the height of arrogance. No, this communal brotherhood is something intrinsic to us, to the European people where ever they may be no matter how far we go back in history. <br><br>As I've mentioned in <a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#76383">&gt;&gt;76383</a> this feeling of comradery is something we must fight to bring back but also something that many are in desperate need of in this moment. A light, a belief in something tangible beyond hopeful words in an old book or what some stammering buffoon says in a podcast. Thusly I would ask you to not merely find faith in your brothers who stand with you in far off lands but in yourself as well, that you and only you can lead you out of the misery of these dark months. A new dawn is coming, not merely as the nights grow shorter after the Solstice but for our people as well if we Will it. None of us are alone, you who are feeling the creeping shadow of misery are not alone for many others feel it. You must not only master yourself and your feelings at this time but use it to become stronger so that you can lift others from this misery also, it is our duty as Men, as sons of Europa to lift each other when we are at our weakest. You may not have a brother by your side at this very moment but know you are not abandoned. You are not alone. If you were would there be a board like this still, if you were would I take the time to write these words? I am a stranger, we all here are strangers on boards like this. But we are drawn together seeking both knowledge and for a glimmer of something more. It is a demonstration of our spirit as the inheritors of Europa and her legacy that brings us together here, it is a belief in something more and a resistance to all that would destroy us. Take heart in this fact, in this realisation for it shows that regardless of what comes we stand together even in the loneliest of months.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#77584">&gt;&gt;77584</a><br>I grew up there during a time when I was not aware of the rot that had been creeping in. To my childhood eyes it was home, a place that was mine. The part I lived in was fairly quiet, the disease that ravaged the center was still spreading out and had not reached a crescendo in my area until some time later. It was bad when I left but it still had some remnants be it the dwindling number of elderly ladies always getting their "perms" at the local hair dressers to socialise as they always did but now with a touch more fear than when I was a child (a perm is a type of hair cut, curled mid length, it was an odd habit) or the gentleman who ran the greengrocers who would always gift a bit of fruit during the summer when me and my friends would pass his shop to go play in the park, his shopfront lined with plastic front panels in place of the open bunches of crates it used to be before for "youths" had taken to either stealing or wrecking his stock regularly. It wasn't all dark when I left but you could see the tendrils of "diversity" were already having an effect. It is all ashes now. The hairdressers where old ladies would congregate to keep their community alive is now a disgusting kebab shop. The greengrocers is now a halal meat butchers. My friends after my departure either dead through drugs or alcohol as they tried to survive in the misery of it all or relocating further afield to the outskirts, hoping against hope the disease will not spread to their new lives. Nought but ruin awaits them yet they will do nothing for their children's future against it all, they have all become weak as they grew to be men. <br><br>I have never returned to that part after leaving permanently, the rare times I go back it is a private affair. A few times a year I go to visit the graves of family and friends but that is all. I have no business there and were it not for my duties to those gone I would never return. I know my wife would rather I didn't but I think she also understands the why of it all. It's a depressing city, oppressive in it's facade of "diversity" and "unity" with the remaining English populations commuting in from the outlying areas, all dead eyed and grey in appearence, mingling with the golem swine the parasite replaced the cities population with. Everyone is on edge despite the forced brevity you'll sometimes find with the "average Londoner", those few locals who tried to stay inside the belly of the beast never seeming truly at ease and for good reason.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Lining all of this as you point out is the odd "esoteria" or what the local councils call "art installations" dotting it's main sections as well as the odd facades on certain buildings. I've seen them a few times over the years, degenerate pieces of objet d'art filling the parks and plazas especially. You'll find they always have a parasite funding these monstrous abominations, they are awfully fond of placing them near beautiful architecture. If I recall correctly there was one such horror, a legless and armless pregnant woman adoring on of the columns in Trafalgar Square. I remember when it first went up and thinking even in my pre "red pill" days that it was a disturbing piece. I can assure you however it has descended far past degenerate and esoteric art in that city. Yes it does have the odd "Masonic Egyption" oddities but that's present in a wide number of cities in Britain (Edinburgh has a number of them as well as an interesting Obelisk) but these are tied to the semetic idealisations anyway, they are simply presented in an alternate form, the more disturbing pieces are the ones akin to the mural at the base of the Eiffel Tower. If you want a glimpse at the degeneracy and odd "esoteric" statues there are two places particularly rife with them, that of the area surrounding the disgusting den known as the Tate modern art gallery and an area known as South Bank. Both are havens but you'll find then all over central as a general rule.<br><br>There is one more thing concerning London of note though regarding the esoteria angle. You'll find that despite the addition of the brutalist buildings built around the city within the mid 20th century they have still tried to remain true to the classical structure of the city overall, many of the odd adornments have been added later for reasons unknown. To my knowledge these adornments begun on a smaller scale when some of the Egyptian surveyors of the 18th/19th century returned and begun emulating some of the styles on the recovered examples of art and statues out of appreciation for it with them initially adorning their places of work inside and out while there were also gifts of these pieces by Middle Eastern leaders during the 19th century such as Cleopatras Needle which was gifted to celebrate Nelson's victory at the Battle of the Nile as well as other gifts to celebrate the Battle of Waterloo (this alone was an event worth looking into for this battle made a number of parasites very rich). However this does not explain the odd murals and Obelisks that were built in the early 20th century but if I were to hazard a guess, and note this is purely conjecture, as the establishment became more and more infested with semetic influences these became indirect demonstrations of their power, although could potentially tie into the more bizarre "Archon" theory some posit of which I remain skeptical but open to if we are to go into esoteric concepts. My view on these odd statues is a nuanced one, I believe it began as an appreciation for discovery and a fetishisation of these discoveries initially then morphed into a "flex" overtime as it were for there is something distinctly alien about these objects in appearance compared to their surrounding buildings, they deliberately do not fit. It could be an early prototype of the "modern art" demoralisation angle the semite is so fond of with a deliberate attack on standard European aesthetics but again this is also conjecture based upon what we know of the parasite. It would explain as to why they became so prevalent then tapered off over time to be replaced with more repugnant examples of modern art.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">I would type a more well put together post, but I‚Äôve been putting it off lately, and if I don‚Äôt post at least something, I feel I will never get any advice and help from any of you anons that I desperately need.<br><br>I currently feel hopeless with my future, in terms of career and purpose, especially purpose. I‚Äôm currently getting into a career in which the job is very monotonous and boring but would give me enough to pay bills, buy groceries, and save enough to be somewhat decently and financially sound.<br>I also feel like I have no purpose to strive for and feel like my life will be waking up to go to work an 8am-4pm job every day. Due to this, I hardly set and goals at all as I feel there is no point at all. I live in a location that doesn‚Äôt allow me to indulge in activities or hobbies that I like, let alone having enough cash to enjoy them even if I had the chance pursue them. I can‚Äôt seem to socially connect with anyone, as if I try to engage, I will only get one-line responses. I know I need to get outside more, but there aren‚Äôt any areas where I live that I can be socially active, either making friends or finding and engaging with women. I‚Äòve tried searching for ways to fix this by finding things to do outside of my home, but I live in an area that has only shopping malls and chain stores, restaurants and bars, flat terrain, and movie theaters to be engaged in terms of being social and pursuing activities, and nothing else. Since I cannot find any outlets that I like to pursue in and afford to do (mostly outdoor activities and sports (swimming, outdoor rock climbing, camping and hiking in mountainous areas, and also that gives an adrenaline thrill like sky diving and bungee jumping) I mostly stay at home wasting time and am hardly social.<br>I used to workout, but I hardly do that anymore. Even if I try to, I barely seem to try to. At most was a week of calisthenics and running. Now I just walk long distances (5-7 miles) in the weekends as it is the most effortless exercise I can do. However, my diet seems to be rather decent and healthy-ish and I don‚Äôt engage in the liquid-jew or the smoking-leaf-jew.<br>I had a real goal to look forward to once, and it was (as stupid and reckless as it sounds) joining the YPG in Syria to fight against ISIS. I was very serious about it too. I started to engaged in physical exercise and was very disciplined about it too to get myself conditioned and pass the training academy that international fighters go through, teaching myself guns and weapons from information, manuals, and clubs, and looked up any information and articles about the current situation for foreign fighters and general information about the civil war in both Syria and Iraq. The only problem was I was still in college and it would seem wise to go without finishing my degree. Once I did, I got a job and saved up enough to afford some necessary gear, a plane ticket to go over to Iraq-Kurdistan and travel via guide to Rojava Syria and a plane ticket to return back incase things didn‚Äôt go as planned. However, by the time I had enough saved up, ISIS‚Äô territory was reduced to a small town and later considered defeated and YPG had no need for any international fighters to join. I ended up being purposeless again.</div>

Now the traveling goal isn‚Äôt a goal where I pursue in to enjoy myself (going to tourist attractions, staying in hotels, and getting the best selfie shots like all other people you see do and to post their travel pictures on social media), but to go to areas around the world where I can observe and learn how other cultures and societies interact and live their lives, regardless if I have fun or not (as that is not the point). It would be nothing more than giving me opportunities to learn and engage in firsthand experience of those societies, its peoples, and cultures, and compare that to the one society I live in, its culture, and find ways to improve it and establish my own way to live life. To give a similarity to what this travel will be, as I interpret it to be, it would be like Lycurgus of Sparta‚Äôs travels and return to Sparta, or Peter the Great‚Äôs travels to Europe and return to Russia to improve the country. I want to be able to learn from other societies and return to mine to find some way to improve it.<br><br>I feel like I‚Äôm living in some sort of limbo or a personal hellish dimension of reality, but I‚Äôve grown a strong desire to get out of this hell that has been eating at me for the past few years. I want to fix both my career prospects and finding a noble purpose to live for. Now, I don‚Äôt know about the career prospects and I would sure as hell hate the idea going back to school to waste time and money to switch to another career path that I may or may not enjoy, but I can at least focus on the purpose to live for, as I believe if I can solve that, then that will allow me to get back to self-improving, as it will be self-improving towards a noble purpose. If any anons need any clarification of my current situation in order to give me better advice and guidance to improve my situation, I will be more than happy to do so in reply posts. Any advice and wisdom will help, or maybe anything that you have went through to get out of a similar hell. I just want to get out of mine.</div>

I can‚Äôt seem to socially connect with anyone, as if I try to engage, I will only get one-line responses.

As it sounds awfully akin to such a place, we have somewhat similar things where I reside, the soulless commercialism, the hollow trappings of shambling masses indulging in the most tedious of exercises to numb themselves further. Now there is a reason beyond this description that I believe this may be the truth for; <br><br><span class="greenText">&gt;Since I cannot find any outlets that I like to pursue in and afford to do (mostly outdoor activities and sports (swimming, outdoor rock climbing, camping and hiking in mountainous areas, and also that gives an adrenaline thrill like sky diving and bungee jumping) I mostly stay at home wasting time and am hardly social.</span><br><span class="greenText">&gt;I had a real goal to look forward to once</span><br><br>This strikes me as what one could consider the "purgatory" of the modern European soul. It's somewhere between the hell of the sprawling "diverse" hives modern cities have become and the freedom and closeness of rural communities some others have come to find. It is only in the partial escape vector of suburbia that such a mindset can develop when compared to the constant edge and wariness of a city dweller or the determined mindset of those who escaped the clutches of the modern semetic world and fully grasp what they must defend. What you are currently feeling is the ultimate form of dispossession, an understanding of how grim the world is and how all that surrounds you hangs upon a knife edge, the threat of ethnic invasion and semetic machinations ever looming. You chose goals, noble goals, of self improvement but found over time the weight of the world made your shoulders sag and hope slowly fade. Does this ring true at all? I would also say your goals started mayhaps a tad too lofty though if you are indeed serious when you say;<br><br><span class="greenText">&gt;and it was (as stupid and reckless as it sounds) joining the YPG in Syria to fight against ISIS. I was very serious about it too. I started to engaged in physical exercise and was very disciplined about it too to get myself conditioned and pass the training academy that international fighters go through, teaching myself guns and weapons from information, manuals, and clubs, and looked up any information and articles about the current situation for foreign fighters and general information about the civil war in both Syria and Iraq.</span></div>

  <div class="divMessage">While such a thing I can to a degree understand the purpose of, it is too far flung a concept to just "do". You of course have the first issue of the difference between actual combat and simulated combat but you have the greater issue of that you chose to engage in a battle that is at best only tangentially related to the battle that truly effects you; that of European Dispossession. You sought purpose in the battle someone else. Such a thing even if executed right is just running from reality. You wouldn't be lauded as a hero or a Man doing the right thing, you'd be a stranger in a strange land seeking purpose where no purpose can be found, not for you, not for a man who has no connection to that land. I would say this issue is exacerbated when you say;<br><br><span class="greenText">&gt;The only goals now I seem to have in life are saving up for an emergency fund, having a job that allows me to pay the bills, feed myself, and have a decent roof over my head, and to travel. Now the traveling goal isn‚Äôt a goal where I pursue in to enjoy myself (going to tourist attractions, staying in hotels, and getting the best selfie shots like all other people you see do and to post their travel pictures on social media), but to go to areas around the world where I can observe and learn how other cultures and societies interact and live their lives, regardless if I have fun or not (as that is not the point).</span><br><br>When I hear travel, I do not think of Europe but world wide which would again be a distraction. It is not the world itself you are disconnected from but yourself, your people. Tell me, and for obvious reasons do not be too specific, from where do you hail? I believe from your use of the term "shopping malls" that you are a far flung son of Europa dwelling within the United States, am I correct? If that is true then I can very much understand your dispossession for the semetic power brokers have made the separation between those of the colonies and the heartlands deliberately vast with their exultation of "new identities" to replace those which such men and women truly belong too. For example, the once differentiation of a man seeking freedom from tyranny and those loyal to a crown have been reduced to "freedum luvin' merican" or "drunken' aussie shitposta". They are no longer Dutch Irish nor English or Scottish for the most part and what little identity most do cling to when mentioning these facets is usually some mild adherence to drinking a particular drink or hating a particular European sub group with the overlay of the new identity grafted over it, a new face that covers the true one at the core of the peoples in question. These new faces though, even with the nations they founded and the soil they enriched as they developed new lands, in their hearts they are still sons of Europe no matter where they be, this fact must be reconciled if a man is to find belonging in this world. His homelands will forever be calling to him no matter how far his feet may take him and no matter how many generations pass.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><span class="greenText">&gt;To give a similarity to what this travel will be, as I interpret it to be, it would be like Lycurgus of Sparta‚Äôs travels and return to Sparta, or Peter the Great‚Äôs travels to Europe and return to Russia to improve the country. I want to be able to learn from other societies and return to mine to find some way to improve it.</span><br><br>Your ultimate goal is clearly seeking a reason, is to find identity in an age where the semite wants you to identify purely as a "fan" of some tedious sub culture or political ideal within the left or right spectrum, not a true Man, not a son of a particular homeland, not a Man who belongs to something greater. I once thought like you. I would look at so many different cultures and religious philosophies, desperately grasping at each one in the hopes of finding something, anything that would relieve the underlying feeling of dislocation. Gnostic Christianity, Catholicism, the Hindu texts, Japanese culture, just something that would help me find belonging. But no matter how far flung I searched I found nothing that was mine, nothing that I could truly say I belonged too. Until I looked inwards. I looked at myself, at who I am. I am a European Man. I am a son of Albion with a dash of Nordic and Germanic thrown in for good measure. I am an Englishman. I have my slings and arrows flung at me and for good measure, those who were meant to be our finest have proven time and again to be our worst while those who were worthy of such praise are naught but dust and echoes. But I still aspire to be like those true Men, I still aspire to capture the ideals of those who dreamed a better future for us. You must do the same. You must find to where you connect, to where your blood calls out to. Be it Scotland, Ireland, Germany, France, Belgium, where ever your blood hails from is where you will find your path to finding the Man you wish to aspire to be. It is your heart that is calling you home, that aches for something more. You are alone in this world because you are choosing to be alone, to find belonging in things that aren't yours. You must seek home again.<br><br>What I would suggest is this. Firstly seek where you came from, where your blood line came from and visit there first. Do no visit the tourist traps beyond any great monuments they have, you must visit the lands themselves, you must travel them and know them. Yes, some may consider you "another damned tourist" or such like but as long as you show respect and do not act untoward they will warm to you and may even be sympathetic if you share with them the truth of your visit if a chance comes up. You must soak up this identity for it is yours but do not gorge yourself, slowly imbibe it for it can be a heady broth if taken all at once. Build your identity from the ashes of the old bit by bit, intertwining it and intermingling it with what good facets you hold currently. Use it to understand your nature. Once this is done expand to brother countries within Europa, witness the sights and beauty it holds for they belong to all sons of Europa, we all bear the burden of protecting them in whatever way we can. Visit the beautiful Christmas markets in Germany's quieter cities, witness the beauty of the Nordic tundras, enjoy a glass of fine wine in one of Frances unspoiled areas, learn not only of your direct family but their brother nations, their strengths and foibles, their gifts and beauty.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Should you do this, should you succeed in this then you will finally understand for what you fight, what the true spirit of the European people is. For who you fight and more importantly why. You will find purpose beyond the mundane goal of surviving and finally understand what it means to be a son of Europa, to understand the greater meanings to strife and struggle for only in that can we find beauty and purpose. Mayhaps in this journey you would find the woman you were seeking and find even more purpose in starting a family, this I cannot say for certain of course but a Man with a purpose is a Man women will be attracted to. It is with this understanding of both your identity and yourself that you will find newfound strength to continue, to raise yourself up and fight on once more and know that you will not do so alone. I shall not lie, I feel like I could happily pass out at this moment, this chest infection is taking a nasty toll. But I do not leave a brother European stranded in a dark hour nor do any fellow sons of Europa who believe in our cause. We fight as one. We fight along side you in this dark hour for we understand the undertaking that is demanded of us in order to ensure our survival as a people.<br><br>At this time you are holding the compass but unable to read it, my role in this is to help you read to where the arrow points. It is pointing to where you desire most, to where your identity and thusly your greater purpose lay. I know how miserable these times are, I truly do. I know how it feels on dark nights when it is quiet with only the rain or silent snow for company. It is a miserable moment to reflect when you feel hollow, it feels like the darkness you have tried to keep at bay is slowly seeping into your soul and it takes all the strength you have not to weep at the prospect of such a miserable age in which you cannot find belonging, where all that lays before you is either hedonism or nihilism. But you are not alone in this. Your people are still here, still standing amidst the chaos and conflict of this time. We are all still here. You are lost because you do not know what you seek. In career, in life goals, you do not know where to go. You must go home and understand it, not permanently go there, just learn of your true spirit. Even if a mix of European blood like myself you must embrace all that constitutes the truth of your spirit. It is not in the material or the alien culture that you will find a place. It is home. It is home that you will find the path you seek most. It will not be easy or simple. It will be hard and take time. But you will understand your reason for being. That I can promise you.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">You are not alone, as though you may feel. I must emphasise the importance of Will. Something all humans struggle to actualise fully, especially during these bleak times.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#77782">&gt;&gt;77782</a><br>You can not expect to find interesting or similar people when you are not engaging in activities which pique your own interest, and likewise will be unable to meet those like you and form bonds. I was in your exact situation. Jobs and qualifications I never wanted, lack of opportunities for my favourite activities in this concrete island, such as camping, hunting or hiking... and only a dwindling friend group of losers, quite frankly. Sometimes it is difficult to develop the Will to make a drastic change, when not in a healthy mental state. Doubt, and a stagnant atmosphere can impede your motivation, and so you must change your perspective.<br>But for example, temporarily leaving this country was immensely helpful - for my perspective, as I was able to prove that I could start a new life for myself, with dozens of like-minded friends, and plenty of activities to do that were able to remind me who I truly am. But I then had the realisation that 'white flight' and escapism is childish. All I needed to know was that there were places worth living for on this Earth and that I was a capable man. And so I returned home to be with my people, family and close friends - regardless of their downfalls, for I have a duty to them to be their Man of Action. So the first thing I will emphasise is that travel is something you should definitely aspire for, as it is a good exercise for developing the mind. Not in the white-girl-instagram way but more so the understanding your capabilities, exploring your unhindered pursuit of your genuine interests, etc.<br><br>Secondly, you talk about career. Do not fear taking a step back to take steps forward. I spent much time studying in acadamia, and now I am learning a trade. I faced the same worries about time, money, etc. but now I feel that it is better to bite the bullet so-to-speak than to prolong your inevitable calling any longer. I think subconsciously we all know what we want or have always wanted to be, we just need time to sift through the bullshit to once agan remember who we were before indoctrination.<br><br>A side point, consider the use of psychedelics for introspection into your subconscious, they have helped significantly, as a perspective shifter.<br><br>For physical self improvement, you need both a role model and a purpose, which are intertwined. You will not be properly motivated by looking up to muscular narcissists, for example. Look instead to the image of a strong, protective Father, or something akin to an Arno Breker statue. You must look to embrace your purpose as a Man (I assume), and subconsciously I think you know exactly the responsibilites and purpose one has. The same genetics of perhaps billions of the fittest Males are within you. So do not let doubt cripple you atleast.</div>

Knowing what Germany used to look like, it is no longer a place I enjoy visiting. The most horrifying isn't the streets of kebab shops or the aggressive, cloaked and brown families of five, but seeing inside the mentality of a once great people. I have spent a lot of time around perhaps hundreds of Germanic girls in particular in the last few years, and it has for some time now been whittling away at my soul to see the merchant's disturbing influence on their lives. My only consolidation during times of despair like this is knowledge that we Men of Action exist. We must be proud that we are sane in an insane society, and to realise our responsibility to those whom we love regardless of their mental poisoning.<br>I am coming to ponder strongly on various concepts, such as that of Will, Struggle, and Fate.<br>Without suffering and struggle the world would not be nearly as beautiful as it is, as struggle is the catalyst that has shaped us into the very beings we are today. Likewise it is not something to be defeated by, but rather something to embrace, for through great struggle will be forged an even more beautiful world than before. Our struggle is far greater than that of the last century's - whom despite an immensely difficult situation, a genuine Volkisch empire was forged, through the effective utilisation of their Will. Now our burden is much greater, and henceforth actually something to be embraced, and be proud of, for what comes after strife and victory is a stronger and more beautiful future.<br><br>I apologise if this is a relatively rambling or incoherent post, I rarely make posts, although I have been lurking for a decade.

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#77864">&gt;&gt;77864</a><br>It is quite coherent, never fret about how you present yourself in a place such as this. Something written from the soul holds just as much weight as something written by the hand of the greatest writer so no need to be concerned. <br><br>It is a struggle to see how far we have fallen as you say, it's odd you mention such a thing as I was watching some old footage I found on an old USB while I had some peace the other day. It was me and some old school friends, my guess was late 90's as it was converted poorly. Oh, of course the disease of semetic corruption had already seeped into my city far before then but in the footage, even in the heart of that foul place, my little group were still innocent. It was a football game, nary a token negroid or Middle Easterner in sight. For a moment I was happy in remembering a simpler time where all that concerned me was how much pocket money I would get for some sweets and whose house we were going to play some video games at. Then I realised something. Six out of the twelve of them were dead. Two to drugs. Two to suicide. One to health complications due to medical malpractice by a foreign doctor. One murdered in a street robbery. The rest bar me? Either ran from the pit we grew up in or slowly festering away within it still, obese and ignorant or gaunt and shiftless in short order. Each soul to the last broken and shattered in some way or another. This is the story of so many of our cities and areas now although not nearly to the same scale Germany has suffered. <br><br>Germany, a nation which dared to resist the semetic grasp paid a cost unimaginable to any of us. It dared to dream, dared to be free and it's own brothers poisoned by the lies of the most vile and insidious of serpents turned on it and after their blades were plunged into it's heart this is what is left for both the "vanquished" and the "victors". It's only crime being that of a future for it's people and by extension that of offering a chance at a future for the European people as a whole with it's demonstration that semetic commerce and corruption need not hold power over all people. That a nation can be forged for the good of the people as a whole. This is why the Germanic peoples after such a "rebellion" had to be crushed for they refused to be slaves, to be servants to a beast so foul that it dare not show it's true face lest it be hunted to the last. Those who would resist must be made desolate for otherwise they pose a threat. Little did the parasite understand the European peoples are not quite so easily conquered in it's heartlands or colonies. Yes, Germanic women, much like a great many Western women have become damaged, it is the very purpose of the semite to do that to them for is there any finer exemplar of beauty and grace than the traditional European woman? The semite demands they be turned into a simulacrum of their own foul hags for a darkened soul must taint all things beautiful. It is their envy that makes them such pitiful creatures. It is their arrogance that believing such a thing is permanent that is their weakness.<br><br>You are quite correct in understanding this struggle is what will mark us as Men rather than men and the components that construct such a being. It is the quelled European spirit we must awaken, the one that kept the darkness at bay, that demanded all sons of Europa stand against the shadows that befall them. We are many nations, many wayward sons flung far across this world but we are one people, one unbreakable force that stands against the tide of seeping despair, it is this that marks us as the men who will lay the foundation of a greater future for only Men of Action can, for only Men with faith in themselves and each other can stand against the encroaching tide. I am gladdened to know within the words shared here you find strength and a reminder in what we must all become. We will make it together. As friends. As brothers. We will never tire nor slacken. Raise a glass Christmas Day to this ideal, I certainly will be.</div>

Not surprising given the state of our capital, however.<br><br><span class="greenText">&gt;it's odd you mention such a thing</span><br>There are no coincidences, I feel as though all of us here are living parallel lives in this bizarro world. I'm sure you're aware of the concept of synchronicity, although nowadays I feel more as though there is some guiding hand, uniformly leading us toward our shared destinies.<br>I find interesting the concept of a simulation, and the notorious NPC meme - it truly feels as though only a select few of us are capable of comprehending and taking control over our own existences. I'm conflicted between a complex material understanding of the universe, or the idea of a pre-determined matrix in which fate has ordained our place within it.<br><br><span class="greenText">&gt;Yes, Germanic women, much like a great many Western women have become damaged, it is the very purpose of the semite to do that to them for is there any finer exemplar of beauty and grace than the traditional European woman?</span><br>Very true. By eroding our most beautiful pillar with their poison, the Semite has undermined our societies by removing the gender balance, destroying the family unit. I still see the core values prevalent in our women, and it is my belief that, as strong, role-fulfilling Men to lead, by our side the women will not only follow, but embrace fully a greater purpose.<br>In order to fulfil this role of leader, and to bring the topic back to self improvement, I would kindly request some advice regarding one of my flaws - speech. Being mute during my early years, I never properly developed my speaking abilities, and have always tended towards a mumble/lisp, and sentences can come out completely jumbled, yet when under the influence of psychedelics speech is loud and clear, and I can feel the speech reverberating through my diaphragm, I am unable to replicate this ordinarily. While I assumed it was related to anxiety, at times it feels physically impossible to replicate. I believe it to be my main downfall, and a self perpetuating cycle that I am determined to break free of - would you happen to know any exercises to work on speaking with command, or advice for communicating with others? Socially I do well but I find it a little restraining to be unable to connect my thoughts to my speech at times.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Food is one of the essentials of our existence, providing the energy we need to create and grow.<br>As an essential everyday skill, and a form of art culminating from centuries if not millenia of our ancestors' relationship with the land, cooking is a chain in the link that is being lost. With globalisation, fast food megacorps and New-Age diets, traditional cooking methods that ties us to our land and people, and allows us significant self sufficiency  is becoming an increasingly threatened way of life.<br>With poor nutrition and knowledge, a significant percentage of the population has been quite literally reshaped into overweight, unsightly caricatures of humans, barely resembling the men from which they descend whom built the very nations in which they reside. In many places where such food becomes a viable alternative to home-cooked food, it is unbelievably easy to indulge especially for those with no cooking knowledge, and so these people end up in detrimental physical states.<br><br>For those unfamilliar with cooking, I suggest recipe boxes, in which self chosen recipes and all ingredients are conveniently delivered to you, as a good way to grease the groove and make it easier and something fun to get involved with.<br>With the internet, access to virtually all types of recipe are accessible.<br>Spend time with parents, grandparents if you can, to learn more about their cooking traditions, for it is your role to preserve them.<br>Cooking is a social event, invite friends over, family, etc. and make/share food together. Make a cheap and rewarding event out of it.<br><br>In terms of diet, I would suggest calorie counting to control your weight, eating at a surplus or deficit where necessary for the purpose of weight manipulation. There are a plethora of good quality apps available for tracking food intake. Even if healthy, it is a good idea to do this for a few weeks as a method of portion control, and a way to grasp your macronutrient intake.<br>Whole foods, and traditional recipes tend to be the most balanced foods - they are time-tested after all.<br><br>As with all types of self improvement, you must gradually ease your way into the new way of life, not overcomplicating the process. For example, not trying some organic, non GMO, vegan diet when you are unable to cook or diet in the first place.<br><br>As you progress, consider growing your own food. You would be surprised with how well you can supplement your diet with only a small piece of land, and taking a bare/overgrown piece of land, and using it to create something edible and delicious is an extremely rewarding experience.</div>

I have no social fears anymore and my voice is often complimented such as "you should be a voice actor" by brainwashed normies.

  <div class="divMessage">So I wish to apolagise for my absence over the last month, Yuletide was met with some rather unpleasant events alongside a nasty chest infection which had me out of commission for the most part. Such down time did however allow some formulation of a subject which is especially prescient at this time of year where some find themselves afloat in the malaise of this new year (or decade in this case) in which a Man can find himself falling into darker thoughts much like the tides of Yule within December. This is especially relevant as the full treachery of Trump and the western leaders at large are paraded before us like foul marionettes of semetic puppeteers. <br><br>Today's topic is upon the healing of ones own wounds. This is a painful subject for many but it is a subject we must confront if we are to become stronger.<br><br>An unspoken truth among those of our ilk, we seekers of understanding and justice, is that we all in one form or another been damaged by the very thing we sought. To bear the knowledge we hold, to delve into it's murky depths to discover a fate most foul engineered by creatures filled with hate and to witness the atrocities committed by it's golems is a torturous thing. One cannot tread these waters and remain unscathed. The best way to describe it would be akin to holding ones hand over an open flame. At first you recoil, withdrawing your hand as your bodies instinctual reaction is to escape it, the nerves screaming at you to keep away. But you know within that flame is the object you seek, a truth you wish to recover so you dive in, tentatively at first then longer each time. With each piece of understanding, with each returning of your hand to the flame the nerves within it whither, the pain while excruciating is part of the burden you must carry for truth cannot be handled without such sacrifice. Thusly over time you grow rich in knowledge, gorging on the forgotten and the unseen but at great cost. The skin still bubbles when you place your hand back in each time but the pain ebbs away with all that remains being numbness, numbness and a cold hatred that permeates for those who have wronged us in the most vile of ways. Hatred born of injustice and cowardice, at resentment for those who refused to resist this false reality and a disgust at those who revel in it by choice. It is of little wonder so many of our kin embrace either nihilism or unquenchable anger for how else is a man who sees the truth of the world meant to react, how else can he counter a world and future so foul. We are left off balance and off kilter, our minds never truly healing for the illusion of all that we believed had been proven a lie. Democracy. Equality. Liberty. Freedom. All lies, all words made meaningless by a parasite who ensured it's own goal of sublimation would have these words serve as ties that bind men to their semetic treachery. We find ourselves lost and adrift and in turn hurt ourselves and those we love and fight for in our desperate grasping to pull ourselves out of the darkness such understanding gives.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">The pain of truth, the burden of it, it is something we all carry with us but rarely do we try to heal ourselves of the wounds it causes. I myself even advocate for using it as a fuel to burn to propel ourselves to a greater future, to light the fires within ourselves. But I rarely speak of how this affects us beyond this use. How this knowledge affects all of us in a deeper manner than we realise. Allow me to offer a story regarding this. I've briefly mentioned how I became "red pilled" (urgh, such a derisory term nowadays thanks to it's use by the redundant groypers and pathetic alt lite) but the truth was it was a little after that, it was more when I learned of the true sins done by my nation in pursuit of semetic goals. Discovery of just all we had done was akin to pouring salt into an already open wound, it reopened something I thought had healed over and tore at my spirit. While I was fully aware Britain was by no means perfect in my mind I had always had the illusion that there were at least some elements of our system that mayhaps could be considered noble, salvageable. But as I understood more and more I came to the conclusion it was merely a fantasy on my part. Men I had considered heroes were traitors and those I had considered fringe were Men who believed in our people. In an ironic twist what most modern "culture critics" consider radicalisation was closer to a return to normalcy, a complete departure from the actual radical and diseased semetic ideas of this epoch and an embrace of the true European ideal. Of solidarity between brothers, of unity in purpose, of exploration beyond the mundane of semetic materialism. This return however came at a cost. I found myself and on occasion do still find myself unable to fully communicate with general people. Oh, of course I can pass the time, share some pithy anecdote and play the part of "just a moderately intelligent chap who is a tad introverted" but in my heart I feel myself separated from them. They seem almost alien to me at times, discussing their little movies or discussing some trivial topic from prescribed media, all the usual humdrum of men most grey. I even found myself distant to my love for a spell due to this, introversion was in abundance as I withdrew from the world at large. Each time I considered the future, considered a path forward I would swing from nihilistic surrender to a blazing cold hatred, the fire in me dimming and growing to an inferno as my mind processed more and more of just how far we had fallen and just how vile and hateful the parasite truly is. It left me broken. Misery consumed me. I fell into darkness as so many of our ilk do. <br><br>But a phrase stuck with me even through those miserable moments, a single phrase. "No one is coming to save us, we must save ourselves". The knowledge of all that has happened and all the machinations the parasite has ongoing, it crushes, it seems so overwhelming that to consider resisting seems pointless. That was until I realised as many others had before that to simply live was to resist. Of course, I could of ended my life, surrendered my being and my people at large, it would of been easy. The darker part of myself, the part corrupted by nihilism and semetic taught self loathing from media and culture made me think no one would care. No one would remember me, my death would be inconsequential. Perhaps so. Perhaps I am just one man like any other man who is but a single drop of rain. But the other part of me, the part that railed against a fate most foul, it dragged me up. It reminded me that our people are not as insignificant as the parasite had us believe, quite the opposite. Yes I had grown distant to them, loathsome of some. I saw in them a corruption and surrender to a false reality but then I realised what I had gone through to escape it and found my anger at them turn to sadness. Sadness that all that they could be is being stripped away, all that should be theirs given away freely to the undeserving by crook nosed thieves and the foul puppets who serve them.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">I have spoken of our achievements and greatness in previous posts, it is for this very reason, this understanding of who we truly are and what we have and can achieve. The Colussus of Rhodes, the Library of Alexandra, the eradication of diseases, grand treatise upon the very spirit that inhabits us, even touching the very veil of space, these were achievements done by Men, Men just like us. Of course visionaries, the pioneers of such grand schemes, their names may well be remembered but these Men were not simply individuals. These achievements were not made simply by them but by the collective efforts *of* Men like us ourselves, Men who believed in the creation of these achievements, who served a higher purpose in pursuit of such incredible achievements. We may not remember the name of every stone shaper, of every scholar, craftsmen and labourer who worked on such edifices but we do not need to. They are already remembered in the realisation of these monuments, in the creation of such incredible works by the very fact it was our race, our people, the European people who achieved such things. It was in this I found understanding. <br><br>You and I may not be some great hero leading our people in a front line, not all of us may not end up surviving to see victory. But we *will* survive long enough in the great skein of things to help push our people forward as so many others did before us. This is what lifted me from the malaise, this understanding that even against such incalculable odds before us the spirit of the European man can still triumph for even in his darkest of hours there is still a spark deep within him that not only can shield one from pain but deliver us from it. It is a belief, a faith, something which I have spoken of previously also. It is not a faith in a semetic God, it is not a faith in Christ although I will not attack such figures unless provoked, it is a faith in something greater, in ourselves and what we can achieve in pursuit of nobler ideals. It is a belief that we have survived such horrors before even if we do not fully comprehend it. It is of no shock to find so many ancient European myths concerning end times all share similar traits, an external influence causing a degredation of our cultures and our people ending in a victory at great cost. Be it the Nordic Rangarok, the Celtic Prophecy of Baph the crow Goddess or even the Kali Yuga of Hindu-Aryan prophecy, these tales all speak intrinsically to what transpires today. Treachery. Horror. A time where good Men are few and weak men are plenty.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">What we face is not unprecedented. This enemy is not new nor clever. I would posit that we ourselves are the only true counter to such a corrosive and vile creature. Some may put it in the window dressing of Christ versus Moloch or "freedom loving people" versus the "Masons" but such thinking is the realm of children needing a framework to place over what lays before them, an offshoot from the direct situation. The truth that heals, the balm that soothes is not that this is some battle between us and a volcano demon, this is not some conflict with a shady cabal that hides in shadow, this is a battle of Man versus parasite. A battle that takes place within all aspects of the European conciousness, that takes place in the physical and the mental. <br><br>We are not at a stage of open conflict yet where bullets are flying and buildings are crumbling although it feels such a thing is close. No, we are at the stage where the physical is infirmity by gluttony and the spiritual is corruption by adulation of the depraved and degenerate. When we pull the roots of the corruption from ourselves it leaves bloodied scars where once was firm if poisoned flesh. The flesh heals again, healthier than before but the mark is left, the skin disfigured. These scars never disappear. But they can be turned from ugly to just a mark to remind of how the wound was earned. A lesson learned rather than a pain to bear. That is the importance of accepting the pain and using it, of pulling ourselves from the agony it offers and using it to reinforce our spirits against the grim tide. Only through strength of Will can we be victorious. Only through sacrifice and bravery can we emerge in the true form of the European Man. It matters not who you are or where you are, if you are of European blood then within you lies the heart of heroes.<br><br>Until victory be won.</div>

This subject you addressed hits the nail on the head perfectly. Perhaps I might've had the sensation of disappointment in those I meet in person lessened where I to live in Britain instead of America. There seems to be higher levels of stupidity here. The indoctrinated boomers flat out refuse to listen most of the time. It's a dice roll with mid-20s through 30s, and less than that speak ebonics by majority even when white. Displaced European ancestry people, frankly, are the only ones I tend to have success with. It has proven too much of a risk when a non-white is within earshot. There is only one part I disagree with about your thesis, and that is just to simply live is to resist. I would argue that actually resisting coupled with continued survival not just of yourself, but vesting interest in the survival of your people, is the best (though vague) strategy. Regardless, I hope you have kept these speeches recorded somewhere such as a text document, writing or something similar. These are much needed intelligent reflections you keep gracing us with on this board. In short, you should consider authoring a book.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#78155">&gt;&gt;78155</a><br>You are most kind in your words. It is of no surprise to hear how across all our nations generational deterioration is occurring at a constant rate. Attempting to introduce doubt about the narrative into these groups grows increasingly difficult as the enemy fortifies it's positions with distractions and knives put to the throats of those that defy. Trying to lead them to the truth is akin to leading a horse to water. He will follow on occasion yes but he cannot be forced to drink from it. <br><br>Your disagreement is also well met, I phrased my wording poorly. When I say to merely exist I do not mean it in an individualistic manner but in the fact I am a surviving son of Europa, an example of the thing it despises most. While yes at that juncture when I understood this I had not fully realised the gravity of that  fully having only a vague grasp of what differentiates a Man and a man, this being that those who pass through the crucible of self doubt and misery and survive it are the greatest fear the parasite have; an unbroken Will even in the face of such horror. This is something you, me and a many others have reached but something a great many others still struggle with. There can only be one conclusion at the end of that understanding, that only within unity of his kin does the European Man become his greatest, in brotherhood does he find what he truly has been seeking, something I may speak on at some point. <br><br>As for back ups, I do have a physical back up and a couple on some cloud hosting sites. All burner accounts however so the safety of the cloud ones are shaky at best. As for a book, the goal of this work is purely for the sharing of thoughts and an attempt to offer a path through the darkness of these times to those who may need it. I am still compiling all of it into a PDF for dispersion with some editing but this project is something that will never have a purchasable physical copy or if it does it will be purely at cost should it ever reach that far but such thinking is fanciful in my mind. There is too much at stake at this point. We as a people stand upon the precipice of destruction whether many admit it or not. This work is for those who grow tired of the mask of nihilism or grim comedy, those seeking a way forward without resorting to self destruction or aiding the goals of the parasite with unfocused violent outbursts. I refuse to stand by and watch as all is stolen from our children, I cannot. Our ancestors forged these nations for us, they bled and died believing in something greater than themselves while mothers and wives wept as their fathers and sons died upon fields soaked in blood so that *we* would have a future, so that we had a tomorrow. Even if few see this work, even if it is but a handful it must be done. I have to do something other than spend my evenings either reading or at the gym. We must win this, no matter the cost. This is what I can gift towards that end. I give my thoughts and time freely as others have done for us all in times before this. I do honestly believe we can win this. We just need to remember who we are.</div>

You have helped me make a decision on something I had been making some light footed drafts on, courtesy of your mewling you have reminded me of the distaste your ilk leave me with your need for self insertion of proselytizing and hollow words such as "God will save us, just wait for God" whenever something disagrees with your frail viewpoint with the usual accusation of the "masonic" to hide your inability to argue against understanding the greater part of our people when it is not through the lens of Christianity. You propose that we just move back to what led us here in the first place. Never save yourselves, never find faith in yourselves or to ideals of your peoples by looking realistically at what forged them. Just trust and all will be well. "Oh it's because we strayed from God's light". "Oh it's because were all sinners". Very droll. As a people we existed long before Christianity and so we shall long after. I do not go against the idea of God or the spirit for both are intrinsic to us as a people but I will gladly go against those who would make us continue upon a path of self destruction that Christianity now leads us upon with it's constant self flagellation and inability to effect change.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#78409">&gt;&gt;78409</a><br>I have never professed admiration for him nor would I but his work *is* useful if divided from his personal opinions.

His work can be used to augment understanding of leadership principles, we should use it in the same way one can understand semetic tricks by reading the 48 Laws of Power. His unwarranted ignorance concerning National Socialist principles or the Jewish issue should indeed be pointed out as should his eventual descent into insanity but much like modern culture we should take what we can use and abandon the items without worth which is fairly evident in the case of Evola. His opinions on topics beyond tradition and leadership are akin to the opinions of a chef on flower arrangements at a dinner table. Yes, he may have a vague idea but it lacks nuance or understanding of what is being spoken of.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Onto the topic itself however (thank you 555f19 for helping me choose to do so);<br><br>A most controversial topic awaits this time. That of the topic of Christianity and the importance of avoiding it's trap. I have debated about whether to cover this but I feel it must be done even if it may cause hurt. Part of me resists posting this, the attacks on Christianity have indeed been brutal of late but simply put this is due to it's connections to the European ethos that I hesitated however now this is something that Christianity itself is inflicting harm upon. <br><br>It is absolutely unquestionable that the subject of Christianity is a tempestuous one. A man can argue for and against with ease but in the end it is only with a firm understanding of both the history and the actions of this faith that we can decide a fairly firm conclusion. Those who decry it as a "kike on a stick" while simple in their ethos hold a grain of truth, those who profess "it can save you" also bear a portion of truth as well even if blinded by simple rhetoric. The uncompromising truth however is somewhat prosaic. We must look at Christianity within the wider context of our people, it's origins and where it has led us to fully grasp it's ramifications. So let us begin.<br><br>In it's initial form the Christian faith was a clear piece of the tripartite Abrahamic religious system, a system of principles it deviated from to a degree while still partially relying on Judaic frameworks (said deviation more so in the New Testament compared to the Old Testament) presenting a rather serious issue with it in it's base incarnation. One need merely read the Old Testament to know of what I speak, from the tale of Isaac to the "borrowing" of Assyrian and Babylonian concepts and legends within it's construction, it is a very well engineered piece of rhetorical machinery. Now I do not say this to belittle Christ or the concept of the Christian God but these facts concerning biblical texts and Christian theology at large are undeniable. It is a faith built upon other faiths. A faith that subverts, not unlike Judaism itself. Now, no doubt some are perturbed at this comparison and rightly so, for is not Christianity the religion of the European people? Well, yes and no. There is an uncomfortable truth for those who profess Christianity is the true bulwark against the parasite, this being that the parasite has already taken apart Christianity, with ease I would like to add. Allow me to explain.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">It is quite true Christianity was remade into a European religion, from it's art to it's theological teachings, it all rings true to the spirit of the European peoples, or rather it did for a time. But due to the very engineering behind the religion specific loop holes and schisms occurred, be it debate on veneration of the Holy Spirit over some other aspect, be it how best to worship, be it certain granular concepts, Christianity proved to be a most divisive tool. If Christianity truly was the religion of the European peoples then why did it's character change so much and become so malleable? Ah, now the classic defense of such events is always "Well x wanted y which goes against z", a defense that one may note is almost always used in some form or another. "Well Catholicism is based", "Well Mormons are based", "Well Luthor is based as he rejected the kikes", it all goes on and on as each separate sect makes up it's own little rules and declares itself as the right choice while forever being unable to find proper unity within the whole. Some may try to put such conventions aside for the good of the people of Europa but sadly these rare individuals do not understand two fundamental flaws. Firstly, by writ of the actions of their own sects and deviations, they will never find true unity for Christianity has become too infested with semitic influence and internal power struggle. The second is that the Christian ethos has not only shown itself incapable of defending it's followers but has been detrimental to them in the long term. <br><br>Now when I say detrimental I do not just mean the modern incarnations but far beyond that. Consider for a moment one of the "prouder" events of Christian history, that of the Crusades. Do you recall that classic phrase "Deus Vult" or rather God Wills It? A very interesting phrase, one with fascinating connotations with the "willingness" to assemble an army of Christ a millennia ago. Ultimately despite the Churches best efforts against the Islamic invaders it failed to keep it's holdings, repeatedly. This has been something that has occurred time and time again as it's sordid history continued, an absence of effective action beyond taking some minor retribution against heresies and even then much hand wringing was evident as their own internal politics came into play. It is a faith mired in it's own incompetence, let alone it's failure at resisting Jewish infiltration. I mean consider, did Christ not drive the Merchant from the temple, did he not warn of the "synagogue of Satan"? He clearly did so why is it that the Church and it's countless followers fold so easily to their machinations. This religious "epoch" of the European peoples, this grand beauteous faith, how did it become so redundant if not for it's own failings? Cromwell sought to let the Jews back into Britain seeking to convert, a devout man of faith, and in doing so infested a newly forming empire. The Goth clans after the fall of Rome, adherents to Christ accepted the semite again then as well as they surveyed the ruins of their fallen foe, hopes of converting and again they too fell to it's influence of mercantile. The Byzantine, the papalcy, Constantinople, countless times Christianity has failed to guard the European people and itself against the depredations of those who would prey on us.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">One must ask themselves, just why was Constantinople allowed to fall? Were they not also followers of Christ, were they not also "children of the lord", should good Christians of not ran to it's defense? When in it's darkest hour, why was this jewel allowed to be pillaged, sons and daughters of Europa either slaughtered or turned into slaves to labour under foreign invaders, women raped and children murdered, why was this atrocity allowed to happen? Why when the Islamic hordes arrived at Vienna was it not an army of Christ but Polish Hussars who led this charge, where were the noble and the pious then as cities burned and the sons and daughters of Europa lay violated by vile invaders? No where. No rallying cry putting fire into hearts of heroes, no men of Christ marching to protect their kin and their faith en masse, just politics and cowardice. No "work around" to be found by this petty fiefdom of manipulators or charlatans to turn the tide that time. No, they may be brothers but Christianity demands politics take precedence over brotherhood and action and like any good Christian you must adhere to the principals set out, not act for the interests of your own people. You'll be rewarded in the afterlife after all, trust the plan. My, that almost sounds akin to something else of late. But let us be generous, let us consider that this inaction is for a good reason, that Man is at fault and not the then corrupted system that he is tied to. After all, is the outcome not as "God wills it", that these horrific things occurred not to failings but part of a grand design? Is it not required for these atrocities to happen as it was fated to happen, that delightful get out clause where one can wash their hands of their own faiths failings and their own personal ones by "passing the buck"? This has always been one of the foulest concepts within the Christian ethos I've found, this lack of responsibility. Oh how easy it is to be high and noble when it's the spreading of the word but how hard it is to defend it when facing attack. <br><br>There is something else one must contemplate when considering the Christian faith, that of it's uses. Many know of the way the "preachers" left for strange shores in the age of exploration, selling the tale of Christianity to all who would hear no matter the creed or colour. One must ask *why*. Why do this. To save their souls? Fair enough but upon what vaunted arrogance does the Christian faith have to claim itself as the "religion for all"? (I eagerly await the "hurr u r just a heathen, u mad bro at that statement). Ah, but it was out of "love" was it not? Love for the fellow "man", love to save the soul of even the most barbarous tribe, perhaps even to "civilise" them in the hopes they too could share in the glory of European achievement, that they could emulate it (a very naive perspective). But I would posit it was something more than simple love or an attempt to civilise barborous tribes. Consider the backdrop for this action. By the time these preachers arrived at these shores the Christian church already had seeds of corruption within it, already was diseased by external influences and material needs not unlike certain other semetic religions, the spiritual second place to finance in the grand skein of events.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Oh the individuals may be pious, may be honourable and true to their faith. But the Church itself? Do not insult people by claiming it too held these beliefs. I would posit that this "conversion" scheme, this mass whoring of the Christian faith was not an act of benevolence but an act of power acquisition. The first true attempt at a "Global" faith, a method of ensuring power against it's competitors of Islam and various localised faiths within these far flung regions. A goal in which it found success what with the promises of technology and free infrastructure. Long term however we may note something of import around these events, that being the failure to fully civilise these people to much of a degree. It failed to truly lift up their lives within spiritual realms beyond a modicum of succor but it did provide influence however. It did provide tithes. It did connect people globally even if done through vaunted means. Thusly what did Christianity as a whole do with this influence, did it work towards a grand scheme upon which humanity could grow, did it grant peace to it's followers? No. It betrayed them. It used them and allowed itself to be used by others. It schemed, it grew fat with riches and power. It fought within itself, who being right or wrong not decided by it's own scriptures or spiritual ideals but whoever had the most influence and the most gold to attain dominance. Such "nobility".<br><br>Thusly was "global" Christianity born. Thusly was the hegemony created and did Christianity fall wholesale into it's unending fall of irrelevance. The shackles upon the wrists of Europeans was now firmly placed, the *need* to spread the "good word" to all those who would listen inevitably linking us to those not of our kin with the requirement of feeding, clothing, bringing them to "the light" while filling pockets and diluting it's own message even more so in order to shoehorn it among the alien peoples. With this power it did nought but bring the European peoples troubles but it did not matter for the Church for it had it's own interests at heart, those not being those of the people it claimed to preach to. No, I shall not claim the simple followers of the faith responsible nor shall I claim there was not good Men among these masses. But I shall lay at the feet of any who would claim Christianity can offer salvation a call for answering to *how* it can still offer hope for our people. It has proven corruptible, dangerous, even before the events of the Second Vatican Council.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">There is one further charge I would lay at the feet of modern Christianity that is directly connected to it's need to subvert. That of the destruction of the original European mythos. Yes, under the guise of Christianity great monuments have been erected within Europa, incredible edifices worthy of the people who created them. But these edifices, these achievements all came at great cost to ourselves in the grand history of our people. It is often glossed over how many Europeans who resisted this Abrahamic religion were put to the sword, how many towns were engulfed in the "cleansing" Christian flames, how many were slaughtered to make the European continent submit to it's teachings. Of course we all recognise the truth of "might makes right" but that does not absolve Christianity and it's claim of being "European" of it's actions, if anything it makes one question them further. If the Christian faith is so pious, if it's ideals so noble then why did it insist on destroying and subverting so much of our peoples heritage. Why did it have to whore itself by pretending Woden was an analogue for Christ, something recorded within multiple works, why did it have to hide among European traditions and holidays in order to "fit" in. It's actions do not fit some "noble" religion preaching "salvation", it fits with semetic concepts of subversion and blood. It stole a great deal from us and offered little beyond a mask upon which was placed over European advancement and ideals. It is not Christianity that makes the European soul, it is Christianity that has tried to influence it into what we are today. Weakened. Vulnerable. No doubt some would reply with the analogy of "well its kinda European, getting rid of it is like throwing the baby out with the bath water" to which my response is if the baby in question is slowly killing you I do not care if the bath water goes with it or not. There is a more truer analogy than that for the situation we face today however. <br><br>Imagine an apple tree if you will, it's fruits most delicious and glistening, an apple tree you helped grow and nurture from sapling to today. One day as you lay your eyes upon the branches once more you see the fruit that has nourished you for so long appears less vibrant, has less luster. You return day after day and watch as most of it's crop whither and the bark slowly darkens, still caring for it none the less. Then one day when you return to the tree you find most of the fruit has rotted, only a handful of still ripe pieces dot it's branches. The sun is still shining but the soil in which the tree grows is poisoned, the fresh water you provided has done little to slow the rot. All your ministrations to preserve it and restore it failed. You can stay with the tree, try to keep it alive despite the corruption seeping through it as parts of it bark slough off and bloated insects make their homes within it's dead branches, it's demise clear for all to see other than the most blinded. Or you can pick the remaining ripe fruits, their skin still glistening and the meat of the fruit still pure and unmolested, savouring the taste of it and planting the seeds from it upon new, fertile soil. Modern Christianity seeks to bring this tree back to life never understanding the soil it grew in was risky from the start. We must be the ones to ensure it's seeds do not go to waste and grant new life as the old tree withers. Something new must be born from it's seeds, a better soil must be chosen.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">It is not unfair to say Christendom for the most part is beyond salvage at this point. One cannot hold the individual Christian at fault, nor should they. But as a faith it must either atone for it's failings which is unlikely or be brushed aside. At this time Christianity does not offer a connection to the spirit, it divides us from it, it places man above nature rather than working in conjunction with it, it offers no real ascension or pursuit of greatness, merely a quiet death with the promise of something else after we fall all the while serving the interests of itself and the semetic elite. It makes us pay adherence to something that intrinsically is not our own. We can place as many veneers over it as we wish, we can dress it up as beautifully as we please but it does not change what it is and what it has done. At it's heart it is an Abrahamic religion, one that has played a pivotal role in our past ascendancy and now our destruction. But that is not to say we should ignore it all together, no I would not suggest that for despite it's weakening tendencies some of it's teachings are useful even if it is composed of subversion's of traditional European religions and concepts. <br><br>In my eyes Christianity is indeed something to learn from, some of it's values do hold weight. But I would nary embrace it fully for it does not offer hope nor a future. If brothers wish to stand truly against the parasite and the gloaming darkness that comes then they can still freely hold Christ and the Church in their hearts, none would deprive them of that. But they must understand that the survival of our peoples takes precedent over Christianity. That we do not serve Christ in this grand conflict, we do not serve an Abrahamic faith. We serve our people. We serve our nations. We fight to protect the very soil that was entrusted to us so that our sons and daughters may have a future upon it. We do not fight in their Gods name. We fight in the name of Europa and her colonies. That is to whom we entrust our faith, in our brothers and in our Will to gain victory. There is an unspoken reason as to why the only Christian iconography within populist circles is the Celtic Cross. Why all the rest are ancient European or Paganistic symbols. It is because all those other ones hold truer to ourselves, they are more implicitly a part of what composes the European spirit. It is because these symbols are ours and ours alone where as the cross is now a global symbol. It was given away freely and thusly does not belong to Europa, it is a fair question to ask if it ever truly did in the first place. Our people lived and thrived before Christianity. We shall do so again after it.</div>

A man born of a Galilean is a Galilean. A man born of a Pharisee (which is a jew) is a Pharisee. You might have seen the full explanation of these lands being separated in the past, but if you didn't, let me know and I'll be sure to re-explain.<br><br>As for the rest of your posts, I'll admit it. Christianity does not help us in this world. It is purely a spiritual subject. Too many Christians seem to be so concerned about the afterlife and couldn't give a damn about what happens in this life. <em>'Many</em> also consider Christ's death "salvation for their sins" to mean they can do whatever they want because their sins are forgiven. But it's more than that, as you have explained in enough detail already. I must refer to my background for this. I was raised <em>Catholic</em> (through elementary) and then put through a <em>Lutheran</em> private school. There was mass every single morning before classes. Church service. It was some serious indoctrination rather than letting us choose for ourselves. This along with "Science" class where we not only practiced the basest of chemistry, but the science teacher frequently rattled off the lie that Hitler wanted only the blue eyed and blonde haired master race but was confused when the offspring produced were gingers. That science teacher was a jew, and I didn't discover until later than Konrad Heiden was butthurt about what Hitler said. That jews believe themselves to be the master race. Yet another problem with Christianity that didn't exist in the past until Conversos like that science teacher. The jews were frequently expelled by kings and queens for following Judaism in the past, so they took up Christianity as a front.<br><br>However, we started with the King James Version bible. We were made to memorize and recite verses. Over time as students discovered "troubling" verses, the entire school eventually decided that the King James Version was obsolete and it was time to use the New International Version. This along with assigning detention to teens that brought up Martin Luther's "anti-semitism". It was then, as we were once again forced to memorize and recite, this time the NIV, that I noticed the differences. The names of gods the kings of Judea worshiped as they burned their children as sacrifices were no longer there. Much of the previous "anti-semitism" was no longer there. This was a revised edition. An infiltration. I discovered later some other ways jews do this. Christadelphian cultists. The Scofield bible with annotations to support Israel and serve jews as chosen ones. <strong>Many</strong> lobbying groups that also bribe churches, and jewish pastor Conversos that sing hymns to Israel.<br><br>What I know is that jews claim they are the original Israelites. We also get faggots on this board that come here and wail the disgusting lie that "white men are the original jews". What these shills never consider is that the jews lie, subvert and take over societies before destruction. For they are nation destroyers. The shills don't realize the jew has never had an original thought and steals everything. So now the jews have Israel and claim to be Israelites and "the chosen people". I for one have taken the position to never believe anything a parasite says.<br><br>Back to rephrasing and adding to what I said before. We will never make any progress for the sons of Europa with Christianity, for it is a spiritual subject and not a physical one. The Third Reich absolutely did support positive Christianity, however, they removed jews in positions of power in their nation from the equation and also demanded their party deal with physical matters. The care of Germany and the possession of it by actual Germans. Christianity isn't for this life. It won't solve our myriad of problems caused by jews and the destruction of our cultures and ways of life by those parasites and their footsoldiers. The last best method which was eventually overwhelmed by international jewry is still the best. Hitlerism.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">This means never succumbing to jewish propaganda, or else adherents will become well-known traitors by the rest. You can't say the same about Christianity nor any other religion. As Christianity's many bibles become more and more redefined, rewritten, retranslated and infiltrated, their followers complacently let this happen. My retarded mulatto abomination DM (technically boss) has shilled her church to me and others. It's local. I went. I heard the hymns to Israel, the pastor professing that he is a jewish "scholar", and the excuses he made for jews that begged for Christ's torture and execution. "Durr they were just a product of their times. They rally are da chosen peepul". <strong>It was disgusting</strong>. Acceptance of jews is simply not the way of those whom follow and appreciate Hitler. Christians that cannot follow him, refuse to admit what their original verses were trying to tell them, and have brought many non-whites into their congregations while professing "love" over their ancestors which fought to preserve their very existence, while denying their culture, are traitors. Nothing more.<br><br>Yet the dumbest most brainwashed Christians out there will almost worship their own pastor and claim any deviation from their watered down bible version is "evil", even when the older versions are better translations without words purposely left out with the intent to hide the jews' crimes. I have come across this mass stupidity way too many times.<br><br><span class="redText">If any Christian cannot hate the enemy which has sought to destroy their own religion, and which is clearly defined and warned about in their own religion, they are debased and useless.</span></div>

The faith does not know what it is any more. Then you have those closer to cultists than believers that throw out cries such as "muh masonry" or some such whenever challenged with things beyond a Christian lens, one finds themselves pondering what there even is worth left among such people when zealotry takes such hold and Men become blinded to both their own texts and the greater European peoples attained knowledge. <br><br>You are quite right that this particular battle concerning Christianity is a spiritual one, it most certainly is and always has been. But the spiritual is always tied to the physical whether we like to accept it or not for they will always be connected through us ourselves. A man cannot be noble of aspect if he cannot believe in something greater than himself, he must find something worth believing in in order to have something to measure himself against. This is why my attack is not upon Christ or the Christian God directly but upon those adherents who speak so brazenly about these subjects yet fail to understand that they themselves in some form or another can be considered heretics to what was true Christianity. That they too failed in their duty. Christianity now can be boiled down to either fierce defenders of a particular sect or as you point out people using it as a fast food outlet for the soul. I know there are defenders for the faith out there like yourself who actually care about both this struggle and the Christian ethos in true equal measure.

  <div class="divMessage">It's why when I approach subjects I treat the spirit as I do, not from a specific Christian or even Pagan viewpoint but from an angle of it being something ascendant, something that is integral yet obfuscated in this modern era by semetic corruption, so that in turn the reader can fit it within his own paradigm, so they can integrate the ideas of strength into their existing notions of what is noble and true. I did not want to launch the attack I did, I know it was needlessly cruel. I've felt troubled about it since I posted it during lunch. I do not want to attack this faith, the stifling idiocy of the fedora tippers and the semetic influence within it is already tearing it apart, I do not want to play a part in wounding it further. I see the slings and arrows at Christianity and it does affect me for my family have always been true to Christ even on these miserable shores. I've just grown so tired of the need for those with questionable goals to insert their dogma and assertions whatever they may be into subjects and areas that require unity. Inevitably such moments lead to internecine conflict as Catholic fights Protestant then someone else comes in and suddenly "kike on a stick" comes up then as you point out the "We are the real Jews" is thrown out followed by Pagan viewpoints which will end up lacking in nuance while ending in the phrase "lad" constantly then finally the esoteric Gnostic suggestions arrive and it spirals into pointless argumentation which just pushes people away from more than just Christianity, it pushes them away from the very idea of a higher understanding of both themselves and the world we inhabit. My viewpoint has become simple due to this. <br><br>Let the European people find succor to keep the spirit aflame from Christ, Woden or even the idea of a gestalt spiritual consciousness that is Europa herself, it does not matter which to me as long as they fight. As long as they find the strength to stand with us against what comes. Whether it can come from Christianity, Paganism or even some far flung corner of esoteric European spiritualism, it is of no concern to me as long as the goals towards the survival and propagation of the European peoples is put first, let whomever give ministration as they see fit as long as it stands by and nourishes the true European spirit. I can see aspects within both Christianity and Paganism that reflect our peoples and our values, I can even see some touches within some of the odder faiths if you squint very hard (I say this lightheartedly although I have engaged in some fascinating conversations with some interesting fellows who read the Hindu Vedas on the topic of European spirituality and Aryan influences within that text). <br><br>I have met incredible Men of Europa from countless sects and offshoots of European spiritual religious teachings. Men of intellect, of wisdom, of both physical and mental strength. All I wish is for them united, a putting aside of the old conflict of "My God is better than your God", this battle ascends beyond that now, our people must find strength in whatever way they can. Catholic must stand with Protestant, Pagan must stand with Lutheran, the religious conventions of old must be paused long enough for us to stand as one. Under one banner for one people. The European people. As you point out, Hitler achieved this, he embraced a reinvigorated Christianity in the Reich but while doing this he also balanced it with European Pagan tradition as well, he found a way to ensure cohesion between the two. He understood the importance of unification. We must do the same but on a scale as of yet unseen by Man. We must unite before all is lost. I withdraw my attack on Christianity but if it cannot find a way to coexist with both itself and the older European ideals then we will all pay the price. We will lose everything. Such a thing cannot be allowed to pass.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#78436">&gt;&gt;78436</a><br>It's understandable why you broached the subject. Christianity has been possessed and subverted, changed, by the enemy. It probably was meant as a counterbalance to Abrahamic religion in the first place, but has lost all meaning in the minds of morons since. The problem as far back as I can remember, of discussing any religion, is that the discussion typically dissolves into shit-flinging. Yet another issue with religions. And you were right about how Christianity has split into far too many divisions to keep us united. On the topic of violent Christian history, however, any time violent history of white nations is brought up, I consistently endeavor to remember one thing. The fact that none of the historical teachings we've had lectured into our minds can be trusted. Semitic influence is a virus of falsehoods that infects not only the body politic, cultures and traditions, family and soil but also history. Having learned what I did about the jewish Marrano Trans Atlantic slave trade after a lifetime of constant guilt heaped on me for my white skin in my childhood, what I learned about the blatant holocaust fraud, and what I know about what is happening with our modern society being subverted and destroyed; I can't trust most historical references anymore. Where German tribes responsible for destroying Rome? I doubt it, despite being "taught" otherwise. Especially after engaging in my own research and discovering how active and subversive jews were in Rome. Where Crusaders violent children murderers? I highly doubt it. Israel are the child killers. Because we live in a modern era of semitic influence, nothing villainizing Europeans can be trusted.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">I apologise for my absence of late, I have felt... Well, somewhat disappointed with myself since my untoward vitriol on modern Christianity and it's troubles. It has left me with a sense of shame which is only now beginning to leave me. I had begun a draft on the topic of faith and why it is such a vital asset to Men like ourselves but it felt a touch disjointed. I think the lingering issue of the Corona virus is pressing hard at the back of my mind causing a mental block as it were so I believe I should actually post something concerning it along with information and advice. <br><br>It's a tad late where I am now however tomorrow evening I will be returning but with a more practical post akin to the food one earlier in the thread but concerning preparations, both simple and more advanced and how to efficiently do it pending your geographical location and financial situation. Why offer difference when it comes to geographical location concerning the subject of preparation? Laws concerning both weaponry and items that may be available to different peoples in different regions. For instance while it is moderately easy to obtain a standard .22 firearm within the US within the UK you are best to go with a simple Barnett crossbow if you do not have any firearm certificates (or knowledge of weaponry at large for that matter, Barnetts are fairly easy to use hence why I mentioned them). Do not fret, it is not a full weaponry list, it will merely cover basic advice concerning the situation and whats available where. I will also attempt to cover as much as I can at large with long term preparations, dispel some of the ludicrous myths concerning this virus such as the dangerous "Whites cannot get infected" while hopefully framing everything in a way that is not quite as apocalyptic as many of the more famous fear merchants have a penchant to do. Do not misunderstand me however, there is a very real potential for this virus to be a significant threat and we must prepare for this situation accordingly. If there are any specific requests for information regarding this or if anyone wishes to preemptively post info-graphics concerning "prepping" I would encourage you to do so but only if you have actually either tried the things suggested for yourself and can verify it's useful knowledge or you know for certain it's practical. I say this only as there has been a few bits of very dangerous information going around such as the advice to buy Elderberry Syrup as a treatment which would be quite disastrous due to the potential for cytokine storm being increased by it later in the infection should someone get infected. I will also cover a few recipes for basic long life food as well as try to locate whatever sites I still can that are carrying equipment such as masks and filters at normal prices.<br><br>I hope everyone is well and if you are indeed concerned heavily with the virus, the best thing to do at this time is not panic. Yes, this information is coming a bit late, I should of prepared a post near the start of February but I wanted to wait and see just how things would proceed as I slowly got my own equipment ready. A part of me hoped I was being foolish and I'd need to put things back into storage, that I had merely been struck with a sense of paranoia. Unfortunately events proceeded exactly as one would expect. Foolishness akin to deliberate malice on the part of Western "leaders". <br><br>Throw in my embarrassment and shame earlier, it made for a rather pathetic situation which stayed my hand on my part for which I am sorry. I know many likely have already prepped in which case you have indeed proven wise but this is primarily for those who are only just getting ready to do so. This does not mean don't do research in the mean time however for those who have not prepared. I will endeavour to cover what I can but do not be idle, it would serve well to learn the fundamentals of long term food storage and how reliable logistics are in your area at the bare minimum. There are some very real issues approaching, we must be wise in how we approach them.</div>

I understand your shame about covering the Christian topic before (I was the one who responded). I was raised Catholic, then Lutheran, then believed it was semitic after waking up to the truth about the parasites, then realized it isn't as the obvious that the carpenter was a Galilean stared me right in the face. Christianity is also one of the parasites' primary enemies. Well that last part I've known for years ever since I've seen kikes spitting in the streets at the mention of Jesus.<br><br>As far as the Corona virus goes, I'm not afraid of it. Media fear mongering doesn't get to manipulate me anymore. It's killing already very sick people, or those with infections, or the elderly and feeble, or the young. If you're strong, your immune system can clearly handle it. Another bonus is absolute morons in charge who shilled for open borders are now demanding closed borders because their own fear of mass media propaganda is working on them too. Then there are the UN "expert" retards who grasp their sweaty hands together and start wailing that closed borders aren't going to solve the problem. Because their primary interest is still in eliminating indigenous Europeans.<br><br>Which the Corona virus would have never spread in the first place if not for open borders worldwide. Funny thing about that. We tried to warn the brainwashed lemmings about continuing to jump off that cliff. They just don't listen.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#78803">&gt;&gt;78803</a><br>Your quite right on the viral situation but there are a few variables that may be problematic long term. There are also those with families and those who have fallen for propaganda, part of our duty must be offering what guidance we can for them. There's a lot of scared people out there, be them young, old, peak of fitness or poorly, as long as their our people we must offer what we can to calm them and give them hope and strength.<br><br>So, onto a topic of the Corona outbreak or COVID 19 or whichever current name they have to detract from it's source and effects. What I intend to do here is tackle this in three specific sections. There are as follows;<br><br>- What the virus is and isn't as well as it's potentiality and limitations<br><br>- Immediate short term and probable long term effects of the outbreak and how to theoretically mitigate them as well as cover a few more outlandish situations just for the sake of covering them<br><br>- Practical information and guides on how to deal with it and how to ensure the safety of loved ones and those that look to you for guidance.<br><br>Now I want to mention I am going to apprehensively include some rudimentary infographs and such in these posts. Yes they are more themed towards those more /k/ mindsets however practical guides can be of use and sometimes can offer a sense of security for those who haven't seen them before. Some of the guides are oddly excessive but I find it best just to accommodate their zeal. <br><br>Let us begin. Firstly, just what is this virus. The first thing to deal with is the "just a flu" propaganda that the WHO and it's lackluster servants were pushing. We must also discount the apocalyptic predictions of social media "savants" who proclaim this is the End of Days and that you should buy this or that, it will surely help you deal with this viral apocalypse. What is happening is undeniably an unprecedented event with ten percent of the global population quarantined and twenty five percent of global industry crippled. Yes, the ramifications of China's little pet virus are quite significant. We have not in human history seen something of this scale occur so I would advise we be wary but calm about this situation.<br><br>Symptoms of COVID-19 are;<br><br>- Fever<br>- Cough<br>- Shortness of breath<br><br>Now the more observant of you will immediately notice this is quite literally flu symptoms. At a period where flu is fairly common due to weather. Yes, as you have already concluded this makes for a very interesting situation for us laymen who wish to avoid potential exposure whether it be for fear of infecting family or friends considering it requires a proper test to accurately detect. <br><br>So what is it exactly. It is a variation of the regular flu in the same vein SARS and MERS are as well, namely it's a virus of the same family just with different infectivity and lethality. It's lethality at this time is lower than SARS and is certainly lower than MERS however unlike both this is far more contagious. But how contagious you may ask. You'll likely of heard the phrase r0 of late, this is simply how many one infected individual will pass the disease onto. The WHO have repeatedly obfuscated information regarding this with claims of around 2.4-2.8 infected, the mean average appears to be around r0 3-6 infected depending on the location and obvious cultural attributes of said location (e.g. standard things such as handshakes, the French kiss on the cheek, the Italian normality of close physical contact with friends and family etc). To simplify this piece of information we can consider this a highly infectious disease essentially, something to be concerned with yes but not one that requires you build an airlock to your house. Yet. I jest, I jest, as I said, it's contagious but it's not semetic Hollywood level disease spreading.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Now onto incubation, there's two important things here. Firstly, many who catch it will be a-symptomatic for a duration. This means they'll have the virus but not know. This is one of the biggest problems this virus poses hence why most governments seem to be in a holding pattern buying time rather than stopping it as simply put thanks to the free market, open trade and open borders we must offer up our people to this virus as denying these progressive ideals would be most anti semetic and intolerant. Now concerning time frames of this virus most outlets and information areas are listing the incubation before symptoms appearing to be 3 to 14 days. This is in fact inaccurate. Current models from China suggest it can take *up to* 28 days after initial infection has been confirmed. This makes for a highly disconcerting prospect at first but we must remember that this is what we could consider the *maximum* incubation, a possible variable, not the rule so do not go believing this is the common event that transpires. It does however demonstrate a very clear flaw in the handling of this virus by our oh so benevolent "leaders" as almost all nations seem to be using the 14 day model.<br><br>However there are a few more less discussed details concerning this virus we must address. Firstly the risk of needing dedicated medical care. Now figures seem to be varying depending on where you source, a popular claim is that 20% of all patients will need intensive care, some sources including my oh so transparent and kind government claim 10%. Now both of these figures are somewhat misleading however as there are certain things that could increase or decrease these chances, age is a definite factor with older generations being much more susceptible while those under 11 appear mostly unaffected. Simply put due to incompetency or a deliberate fudging of the numbers we do not actually know for certain the criteria for the likelihood of needing ICU admittance, at least not firmly. Logic dictates older generations and the infirm will suffer hardest but without hard and most importantly reliable data we cannot say for certain. What can be said for certain however is what seems to transpire in order to need ICU admittance. From my understanding after overcoming the initial flu like symptoms there is a period of a few days where it appears you are well once more. However this is a falsehood as the virus is still in your system. It is at this point some experience a very serious viral pneumonia and most likely ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Now this is one of the biggest issues with this virus as the immune system has already been combating the flu component previously. When this part comes into play is when you are likely to sink or swim. The immune system during this time in the state that it's in will apparently, if what I've read is correct, do one of two things. Your immune system is too crippled to deal with the virus meaning assisted breathing resulting in severe lung scarring and likely long term health problems due to the need to employ powerful antivirals or the opposite occurs what is known as a cytokine storm. Now a cytokine storm for those who do not know is when your immune system quite literally going into overdrive in order to try defeat a virus. It ramps up so much your own immune system essentially destroys you by cooking you inside as your body temperate reaches levels that are fatal if not handled properly. Some of you may of seen footage of patients going into fits or their body spasming as if dying, this is the cytokine storm in action. It's rather horrifying and I shan't share the videos but if you are morbidly curious it is likely available on most video platforms. Survival rates of those needing ICU admittance which have to go through this are relatively unknown and likely will be for the next few weeks until it expands.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Now there is something that has me personally concerned as if true it's quite a devastating component to this disease however it is not set in stone quite yet and may be merely an aspect of the virus we don't quite understand, that of the risk of reinfection. Footage has repeatedly emerged of the infected quite literally dropping dead on the street or when going about their lives post recovery. A theory emerged some time after on Chinese social media that this is due to reinfection, something that has been confirmed by Chinese medical in the last couple of days at a rate of I believe 14%. Now why is this so significant. Well if the information is correct it appears reinfection shortly after recovery will go beyond merely repeating what occurred previously, it quite literally will invade your heart and vital organs. Now the paper claiming this however has not been peer reviewed, I don't even have it saved so this piece of information can be treated as spurious, the only reason I give it any credence is the confirmation of reinfection by China itself and the footage of victims keeling over. But again it is a case of "We don't have the data yet" so we can't say what is happening for certain. With the propensity for this virus to cause false negatives I actually think personally it may in fact be the virus never left the system of the patient and this is the result of it being left properly untreated. Possibly. I'm not exactly a virologist, this is merely a guess based upon what I've seen and learned of late.<br><br>Something else of import is the rumours surrounding this virus, one of the bigger ones that persisted was the "white immunity". Now this from my understanding stems from the claim it is supposedly much more virulent for those of Asiatic descent due to ACE2 receptors and so forth. Essentially this theory boiled down to the Alex Jones tier idea that it was an ethnic bio-weapon aimed at dealing with Hong Kong or the Islamic component in China. Although the idea has died down of late it still pops up here and there and must be dealt with immediately. Risking a single son of Europa by giving him a false sense of invulnerability is both vile and manipulative for he risks himself needlessly. This is not an ethnic bio-weapon, such a thing would be incredibly risky to make due to genetic drift, if it wasn't don't you think the semite would of deployed it rather than using the black and brown hordes of rapists and animals?<br><br>Also concerning this virus, something that sent heads spinning was an Indian research paper suggesting this virus had deliberate injection of HIV components to increase infectivity. This is actually true but only by half. There are indeed HIV markers within the virus but this in of itself is not uncommon. What people often forget is that a virus is not like a bacteria, it is technically a living organism. Imagine akin to a microscopic semite, it creeps into a host body, infests cells, subverts them until the immune system notices it's under attack. Now to facilitate this there are always specific parts present within a virus and it's not uncommon for a virus to share components with other virus, it's not too dissimilar to how many DNA based organisms share certain aspects in order to survive in their environment, a virus despite being an RNA based organism is a similar thing in that way. I will agree it is odd that there are three components within this strain that are from HIV however, this is somewhat unusual. Not out of the realm of possibility by nature itself but still, it's intriguing.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">As for vaccines, well the very nature of the virus and how vaccines are developed suggests this will be either a long shot or take quite some time, most likely over the commonly believed twelve month mark. A virus has a propensity to mutate as we all know, it is these mutations that make them such a pain to prepare for. It's why Flu shots are always subject to fail in some regard, you cannot prepare for every strain of the flu. Now a vaccine for the main strain is actually fairly likely, from all reports it's fairly stable as a virus meaning mutations are slow. Some theorise Iran is suffering from a unique mutation but I cannot comment on that as I don't have enough data although their case count has been... odd. What I am trying to say is do not expect a vaccine tomorrow even with it being a fairly stable. In fact if a vaccine arrives quicker than twelve months I would have some very serious questions regarding it. These things take time, small scale voluntary testing, larger scale testing, refinement, production, it's a slow process to make an effective vaccine. As for an anti viral it appears there is a flurry of information out there concerning tests of them, some using HIV anti viral, some using anti malaria drugs, the highly questionable Israeli anti viral that's being tested. You know, that's another subject worthy of independent investigation, how an Israeli biotech firm so quickly offered up it's anti viral for testing. Now is not the time though but it is worth having a look at, their company is also one of only a very small few who are still green on the Jewish stock market.<br><br>Now here I am going to go into a little bit of conjecture, just follow along for a minute. I do not believe this virus is entirely natural. In fact I personally err towards it being a man made creation wholeheartedly. Only not in the manner one would expect. Based upon what I've read and heard regarding the Level 4 Wuhan Bio lab (for those unfamiliar there was a bio research lab not far from the supposed "wet market" the virus supposedly originated from) it is increasingly likely a breach of safety protocol allowed this virus to escape. My perspective is that the nature of this virus is one of two things. The first is a prototype to an experimental virus, it has certain hallmarks that make sense to this. What I mean by this is that it is not designed to wipe out but rather cause disruptions. To cripple infrastructure due to lack of personnel able to run it, to essentially cause chaos. It's long incubation time and a-symptomatic spreading suggest this, it's well designed in this way. The other angle is that this is still man made but designed in mind with creating antivirals based upon this particularly engineered mutation. It's not uncommon for scientists to tweak viruses to either predict mutations or to investigate avenues of weakness for vaccine development. Regardless of either of my theories however we are currently living through it therefore just put such thinking to one side for now. It is merely something to consider. The lab also has some Jewish connections as well as some almost Tom Clancy-esque events surrounding where it got samples from also but that is a rabbit hole that could get it's own dedicated thread.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">As an aside, if one were to have a look at some of the leaks on Chinese social media concerning lab workers and scientists who have operated at this said lab over the last year, a clear trend becomes visible. For instance claims from scientists at the lab that test animals were not disposed of properly but also taken by staff for meat or if rumours are to be believed sold *at* the said wet market. Now at first I found myself somewhat taken aback, the claim sounded outlandish, who would be foolish enough to not only ignore protocol concerning clear bio hazard materials let alone *eat* the damn thing. However it appears it may not be so outlandish after all. I shan't go into detail as the barbarity of the Chinese people is something to truly behold, however I will inform you of a few simple aspects to the Chinese mindset, their "ethnic spirit" if you will. They are not a kind nor wise people. They are not. Kindness has been bred out of them whether through countless rending of the disparate historical Chinese populations or the enforcement of pseudo Communism, they are an entirely alien people at this point. A cold people whose famed "wisdom" beyond perhaps the trite example of "The Art of War" now consists of how to most effectively turn your own mongrelised nation into livestock. <br><br>Life is cheap, it is expendable, a coin to be used much like the semites view of us only for the Chinese it is all life including their own. You may think me dramatic but I would urge you to read "Ways That Are Dark" by Townsend to get a full grasp on what I speak when it comes to the Chinese. If one were to look at just what they eat and how they eat, the idea of them actually accidentally eating an animal used in experimentation suddenly makes sense. Try to fathom their concept that the suffering of an animal makes the meat taste better much like Islamic and Judaic practice, witness as blow torch a poor hounds skinned body while it quivers in pain, writhing in agony while some disgusting ant "person" slathers at the lips savouring it's pain. Now apply that to a Chinese lab. If you truly think all the assistants and lab workers at these facilities would truly follow protocol at each and every step I honestly do not know what to tell you. They are a third world nation pretending to be first world and much like like a negroid with technical industrial equipment, nature always will demonstrate such people are dangerous when given such tools and eventually disaster will strike.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">So we have looked at the virus itself, let us move onto the effects it will have by and large upon the day to day in the coming weeks and months. <br><br>So the first thing to expect is within the next few days expected panic buying to begin. You likely have already seen some on television and social media, people cramming as much as possible into small cars, obese black women fighting over the last scraps of frozen fried chicken, sickly looking soy infused adult children queuing in line with their meager collection of chemical slop the parasite has sold them as the hip thing to enjoy, the list goes on. Now these people are not merely utterly foolish in their actions and wanton animalistic greed but also dangerous and no I do not merely mean the risks of an angry negroid stabbing you for not handing over an item they desire. What I refer to is the fact there are so many people gathered there in a single location in fairly close quarters. It is an exponential risk of infection. But what is one to do if they have not prepped, what is the best course of action? What should one look for when shopping for immediate supplies, what if I cannot afford it? <br><br>Well lets follow the rule of keeping things simple shall we. We shall look at overall what is needed and how it can be attained pending financial and locational means. Let us begin.<br><br>The first goal is not to merely think of stocking up for a month to three months as simply "buy more of the usual", such thinking will serve you poorly. For instance, the virus may not arrive in your area for a month, perhaps even a few months, if you stock up on your usual perishables now when it arrives what good will they do if their already out of date or used up? You must think logically, you must employ the same thinking our ancestors did when it came to long term survival with risks of no resupply. Now I do not say this to sell the idea of "FULL SOCIETAL COLLAPSE, GRAB YOUR GUNZ ITS MAD MAX TIME BRO" but rather the very realistic concern of supply chain disruption. Courtesy of our outsourcing to semetic third world slavery pits where everything is produced cheaply and enmasse including food, we operate on what is known as the "just in time" delivery method. We maintain only partial stockpiles at distributors and essentially rely on a constantly moving supply system where things, as it says on the tin, arrive just in time. Ah, such a delightfully robust system don't you agree? Especially in the event of, oh I don't know, major disruption from the place that supplies most of the parts for our logistical services that moves said supplies, medicinal supplies and the incredible amounts of worthless junk people consume on a daily basis. My, what a clever and excellent capitalistic system, absolutely nothing can go wrong with relying on worthless third world labour to do jobs at a level below we could do ourselves at a standard of quality worthy of a dog defecating on a street corner. You also have to take into account the parts used by the logistics of a nation are often also sourced from China as mentioned, at best maybe two or three months of spares are available for most Western companies. This is a constantly depleting resource which means even if suddenly localised manufacturing stepped in to cover for the shortfall there is still a significant gap until for industrial output is matched which will be a challenge when considering China's industrial capacity and the disruption involved in it. What I am trying to say is our current stockpiles are very much living on borrowed time and the elites know that. It is of no surprise Bezos sold off a large chunk of his Amazon stock last month and a number of high end CEO's suddenly left their companies. They know exactly what is coming supply wise.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">So what should you do, you need supplies but places are getting swamped. Well you have two choices. The first is try ordering online. Yes, I know, still has risks associated however when ordering groceries online they will usually prepare the delivery after shelves have been restocked either late at night or early in the morning when the vans are being prepared, it increases the likelihood of you acquiring all you ordered. Yes, some items may still come up short but that will remain a risk for the duration. The second method is going out of your usual area to more rural or suburban locations for supplies. In such cases yes there is a chance for higher prices but also a higher chance of acquisition of materials therefore the trade off is worth it. This goes not only for food but other essentials also. Speaking of lets do a quick check list of things that will be helpful in the event of self isolation.<br><br>- Food and water, obviously <br>- Medical supplies, if on prescription medicines request at least an extra month on top of your regular supply if possible, if not possible look at alternatives<br>- Vitamins and supplements to maintain both a healthy immune system and to maintain a good general standard of health<br>-  Basic emergency supplies such as torches, heaters, portable gas cookers, things like this. While events requiring them are highly unlikely such equipment is always good to have as back up<br><br>So let's start with food. An average human can comfortably survive on 2500 calories a day and can be rationed down to 1200-1500 if not having to be active. Now for the sake of simplicity lets multiply 2500 by 30, that gives us 75,000 for just over a single month. Now times that by however many in your household, if just yourself great, if you have a family then multiply again. Say I have three people I need to care for, I need 300,000 calories for a month total. But what of water, an average human needs 2.5 liters a day, that's 75 a person for thirty days, for my example that'd be 300 liters drinking water. That's quite an amount isn't it? Now luckily despite all the ludicrous issues with my dour little island one of the few perks it has is an excellent and fairly solid water system, at least in my area. It's not perfect no and it could have issues if understaffed but the likelihood of problems is far lower here but in rural areas or in certain states in the US this is a significant issue that you most certainly should pay attention to. Now there is no need to panic though as filling these calories and water needs can be easier than you think. The key is simple, operate on a dollar/pound/euro to calorie budget. What do I mean by this? Well, 1kg of Economy Rice, the cheapest white rice available in the UK is something like 50p or 45p in the UK, that is around 58 cents/.50 euro. That 1kg bag contains around 3000 calories cooked. 15 kg of it would be 45,000 calories at ¬£6.75p. That is not too bad at all now is it. However, rice alone is pretty bad, you need salt, protein in the form of beans and canned meat and so forth and so forth. You need to look at and figure out the best bang for your buck as it were as well as check you can safely and easily store these items. You need to assess and think ahead of what you'll need, what can be stored for long periods all the while operating in whatever budget you have available. Do not forget the importance of the simple things either such as herbs, sweet treats and the like in order to help break up the potential tedium if you have to use these supplies long term.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Recipes for long term food preparation can also be useful, in fact I'll share a personal favorite, one so simple that you can involve your children in it if you have them, that of the Hardtack. Now what is Hardtack. Put simply, it is flour mixed with water and salt to create... I don't know how to describe it, a biscuit that could survive a fairly high caliber bullet? It's hard stuff. Edible on it's own if you want to chew for a while but I'd always suggest soaking it a little in a simple soup or even cup of water. It's been around for centuries, used to be used for naval expeditions and so forth, from my understanding it's still popular in some areas such as Poland and apparently Canada. So, the recipe. <br><br>- 2 cups of flour<br>- 1.5 cup of water give or take, may need to add adjust<br>- 2 teaspoons of salt<br><br>Pour the flour in the bowl and add in the water, no need to be precise as this is idiot proof. Add in the salt then just mix it up. You want a decent consistency, add water or flour as you need it, you want it not too sticky and a tad soft. Flour the counter once it's mixed and roll it out, you want it around the thickness of a pencil. Take a knife and cut it into squares or use a pizza cutter. Once you've done that take a cocktail stick or something you can poke with and put holes through it, you want to make sure they go through the other side of the dough, a skewer of some sort will work. Once done put them on a baking tray face down and double check the holes are running through each biscuit, you want to get the air out of them and these are important for that. Once your sure the holes are good put them in the oven at 375c/175f until a nice golden colour, about 30 minutes usually does it. Once done store in a fairly air tight container and you have some handy high density, high calorie biscuits to keep you going for a good while. Their not tasty. Their not pretty. But they work and that's what counts. <br><br>Medical is where you want to look next. In Europe a number of our medicines are made within EU borders which marginally negates risks to medical supplies however the US from my understanding imports a number of medicines from China. I do not have details on this however from my understanding there has been a US government statement informing they are expecting shortages of a number of prescription medicines with one in particular being almost guaranteed to run out. True to form of course, the public has not been informed which medicine this is however. My, such bountiful information and preparation on their part. Now what I would suggest, where ever you are in Europe or her colonies, is to ensure you do your best to acquire a spare months worth of any vital medicines you require. More if possible but a month should be possible for most. If you are truly a paranoid prepper you can also consider looking at getting antibiotics. Now, in a number of countries these are available from the doctor only however there are some loopholes such as online services which offer doctor referrals for those traveling abroad to preemptively get antibiotics to take with them on their travels to some wonderful disease infest South America, African or Middle Eastern pit. They usually charge for this service but there are a few who are fairly reliable. Do a little research if you insist on going down this road however, do not go blindly. There are other avenues to getting antibiotics such as buying fish antibiotics but honestly these would only be useful in very specific circumstances.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Vitamin supplements are an interesting thing. Some claim their useless, others swear by them. Vitamins are indeed a vital part of our immune system however the best and most reliable way is always through a well prepared, well considered diet. However, in the event of self isolation due to an emerging situation you may need to subsist on a far less nutrient rich diet which is where these will come in. Now one must remember different vitamins will be absorbed at different rates, for instance a solid pill will always be absorbed slower than say a dispersible etc etc, you also need to be aware of dosage. For instance it's next to impossible to overdose on Vitamin C however it is fairly easy to overdose on the oft forgotten Vitamin K. Your best bet is to splurge out a little on a mid range multi vitamin if you fear you are likely to end up in a self isolation scenario (and of course compensate for any who will be relying on you such as children or immediate family). A mid range vitamin usually includes full dosages of the aforementioned Vitamin K, Iron and other oft over looked vitamins as well as the usual suspects of A, B, C, D etc. If operating on a budget however the dollar store cheap ones are a fine alternative, all that matters is that you are at least looking at making sure your system will not suffer from deprivation. As for other supplements there are options such as Allicin (the healthy component of Garlic in a concentrated form), Oregano Oil, Turmeric and so forth which all do similar things in different ways. If you wish to look at these I would sincerely advise doing some research and double checking how they react to what. For instance some were trying to get people to buy Elderberry syrup, a fine item to improve your immune system, however an item that can cause serious issues if one enters a cytokine storm which is a realistic occurrence with this virus in a worst case scenario. Knowledge is key in this area.<br><br>Right gentlemen, I've been writing this for a few hours now and need to actually get to sleep. I'll continue with everything tomorrow night, same as tonight. Just remember, you'll likely be fine, just make sure you take care of yourself and your family. If you haven't gotten basic supplies yet now is the time to prioritise, do so quickly before more of the general public notice their little distractions are beginning to buckle. Oh and don't get scalped please. There is a number of vile degenerates praying on people on a number of sites including the usual flea markets such as Ebay and Amazon, keep your head and think about what you definitely do need and work within reason.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#78824">&gt;&gt;78824</a><br>On top of what this anon has shared, I am a researcher in the healing properties of natural components, from spices to herbs and plants. Something important that may be considered is the effect of <strong>synergistic</strong> compounds--that is, compounds that fulfill a similar purpose, i.e., turmeric and ginger (cayenne as well but it is a pepper and thus a nightshade) target inflammation. Although they may be synergistic however, they also have hundreds of different uses. It takes an effective strategy in registering their properties within the body, so to not counteract any potential healing that is exhibited by their essential uses. <br><br>‚Ä¢Black Pepper: Good for clearing the esophageal lining and clearing excess mucous. Contains beta-caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene that is also within rosemary and hops (and of course, cannabis sativa).<br>‚Ä¢Iodine: Helps regulate the thyroid gland, providing hormones that effectively repairs damaged cells. Has several uses aside from this, has largely been excluded from water and salt to contribute to a sicker population. Good to have on hand.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">No offense, but I don't live with family. Not anymore. It's all gone now. ZOG has taught them I'm "evil" and they bought it. So I am surrounded by nothing but foreign invaders day in and day out in an endless monotonous cycle of death glaring apes all while being well aware their presence in the society I live in is thanks to the parasitic jews. On that note, I'll be sure to cough on every brown skinned shithead and kike I come across from now on. Meaning choking and hacking violently.

  <div class="divMessage">I know the green pill isn't highly regarded here, but I'm sympathetic to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist cause. For anyone on or considering nofap, here's a book that can help with that. You don't have to convert the sexual energy into purely personal interests (muscle, brain, nerve, confidence, etc.), you can also use it to strengthen the volkisch soul, though I reccomend doing the former before doing the later. I'm not trying to promote jewish degeneracy, I'm just trying to help those on nofap. I'm aware hermeticism and occultism puts me on thin ice, but I'd like to request that this post doesn't get deleted, at least before you investigate book related. It helps stop wet dreams, and serves as a release for sexual tension so that you don't give off that "starving man looking at a hot meal" vibe.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/1922AtkinsonBealsRegenerativePower12/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/1922AtkinsonBealsRegenerativePower12/mode/2up</a></div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#71160">&gt;&gt;71160</a> Most of good respectable female workers i encountered , in numeras times around the World , in several African Asian or also Europian Countries such as Romania Poland Hungary Ukraine and many others "through the 90s"  had never led me to complain much about for example not cleaning the toilet good enough or while cleaning houses and sweeping the floors they did a good job "NIGGERJOB" exept the damn lazy monkey niggeresses . The Race of the African monkey Negroids is useless and below any Race of Humanity . Arab , Indian , Asian , Mexicans all Women wich are neither black or white will Basically look down on niggers just the way us white people look down on them . A Native American Indian Woman told me back in those days , her ancestors were the Tribe called " Black Feets " long before they owned niggerslaves , the so called black feets would capture a the few negroslaves owned by their white enemies wich fought fell in the battle , and simply made them do all their dirty biddings. Apparently they even had them negros serve under their tribes feet at the floor as footstool <br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#75729">&gt;&gt;75729</a> The Jews are pushing their brainwashing tactics about niggerslavery on all those poor niggerslaves that had to suffer of our evil white ancestors , wich is tought to us through out the media as never ending story of suffering niggers from it . Im a white german woman who is proud to say that my Grandparents had colonised niggers of East Africa wich 3 niggers still until this very day serve my 2 aunts in the household , and she refairs to her personal hausboy only by the turm Neger &amp; Negerin or and Boy or Girl . They , my aounts and their negroes were liturally born into this life both sides are thankfull and greatfull  <br><span class="greenText">&gt;<a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#77323">&gt;&gt;77323</a></span><br><br>Niggers are not even part of the Humanrace even Mexicans or Native Indians are way above all the nigger slave monkey creatures .

  <div class="divMessage">So I've been redoing some drafts on some topics but tonight I find myself simply lacking focus on them. Despite the copious amounts of time now made available, in an ironic twist I find myself busier than ever courtesy of my wife and child now ever present. But I also feel neglectful of my goals and my ideals by not continuing to offer what I can to those of our ilk in this time of crisis. Now when I say crisis I do not necessarily refer to the virus itself but rather the effects on our lives generally. Our forced isolation and the requirement for us to live in a bizarre holding pattern as it were. So tonight's topic is how to maintain both our physical and mental stability in a time where uncertainty and silence hold domain. <br><br>For some the hours can drag by. Honestly, I would say for a number of us the hours can drag by actually. Yes, a good, well disciplined Man will often be able to fill every minute with a goal, be it physical or mental, he understands the need to challenge himself constantly. However for a Man on the path, such discipline is still some ways away. There is no shame in such a thing for any man seeking to make himself more often has to walk these same paths that the greatest of Men once walked. Now for a number of those seeking self improvement there are a multitude of terms for the previous time where they lived in a state of stasis (those still like that themselves are ironically thriving in this time on entropy), the "neet", the "basement dweller", ye old classical "neckbeard". These monikers for a number of those on the path of self improvement are a former identity they are trying to break the shackles of, the shadow of the ideas behind them looming as we are forced to remain indoors lest some foul uncouth creature coughs in our direction or our delightful police forces break out a baton for the horrific crime of leaving the house for a brief walk in the country away from others. Such an utterly bizarre time we live in in that regard.<br><br>So in this time of stagnation we must more than ever fight the forces of atrophy that will settle in our own minds. I can say this from experience, my reliance upon gym equipment and the disruption to my previous routine has caused some discomfort in myself, I have noticed my belt may need to be loosened a buckle and my evenings of reading and music once being left alone of a night are now extensions of my actions during the day. I have failed in my task or keeping my body strong and my mind sharp as I am sure many others have and to those of you like me who have failed we must address this. <br><br>So how do we shatter this malaise? Well first things first, one must come to the understanding of two integral things. Firstly, this lock down, for good or ill, will not last forever. It is a temporary thing and should be treated as such. Not as a holiday, not a break, it is merely an interruption of regular service. By giving oneself an excuse such as it being a holiday or a break you are doing nothing other than cheating and betraying yourself. Pray tell, if tomorrow some negro or middle eastern creature breaks into your home, would you be as fit to deal with them as you were at the beginning of this event? Of course not, you have lost your edge. You must gain it back. This also importantly ties into the second issue with surrendering to the malaise, that of the importance of your physical form. The greatest defense in the event of this virus is a well maintained physical body maintaining a strong immune system. Regular exercise is vital to maintaining a whole slew of functions within your body and by neglecting yourself in this way you merely increase your risk dramatically. I am sure many here have heard the phrase "treat your body like a temple". Now this does not mean rub yourself with oils and incense while chanting Gregorian prayers (I say this only in jest, Gregorian chants are actually quite nice and essential oils can be highly beneficial) it does mean you must show it respect and care.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">So what should one do to remedy this, it's not like we have access to a full gym set up in our studies or in our back garden. Now no doubt someone is already lining up an image of a Slavic gentlemen lifting a home made weight made of rebar and concrete blocks however we shan't be going quite so rustic in our approach. No, our goal for those without access to proper equipment is maintenance, not development. If you do have equipment then of course ignore this paragraph, for those who do not then follow along dear friend while we try and get you set. Now when I say maintenance I refer to simply ensuring the following;<br><br>- No weight gain unless in muscle mass<br>- No muscle loss<br>- No loss of stamina<br><br>Now do bear in mind, the loss of muscle mass is highly unlikely as it can take several months of no training for it to decrease so do not panic in that regard. What you should be concerned with however is stamina and weight gain. Luckily there are a few simple things you can do to keep them on a decent level and I do indeed mean simple. <br><br>- Lunges. Good for keeping your legs strong and working on the glutes. Arms down to the sides. Take a step forward, bend your knee as you do, stop when your thigh is square to the ground. Don't put your knee past your foot. Push up off your foot and return to starting position and switch legs. Ten to fifteen reps in three sets should suffice.<br><br>- Push ups. Ah, a classic. Bloody good exercise to as it works a good amount of your muscles if I do say so myself. Get yourself in a plank position, arms out and straight. Core should be tight, shoulders down and back, neck straight. Bend your elbows and lower your body to the floor, when your chest just barely touches it extend the elbows and go back to position. Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body as you go. Don't go too crazy on these if your unsure but push yourself as far as you can. Three sets again.<br><br>- Squats. Good for your core and lower body, also handy for back. It burns a fair few calories too which is helpful at this time. Stand straight, feet slightly wider than shoulders, arms at your sides. Brace your core and keeping your chin and chest up push your hips back and bend your knees as if you were going to sit in a chair. Make sure your knees don't bow inwards or outwards. Drop until your thighs are parallel to the ground or as close to without falling, bring your arms out in front of you in a comfortable position as you do so. Pause for a second then extend your legs back to starting position. For crunches it's the same but instead of rolling up your body you just lift your upper back and shoulders. Aim for between fifteen to twenty of these, set of three.<br><br>- Sit ups. Also known as babies first work out. People often neglect these but a strong abdomen never hurts. However if you have lower back problem's i'd say avoid these and just do crunches. Lay on the ground with your knees raised and your feet flat and hands behind the head. Keeping your feet flat lift yourself as if rolling from the head, should feel most of the work in the core. Don't strain the neck during the upward motion, if you are your likely to do a nasty injury. When your chest reaches your legs slowly lower yourself back to starting. Again, ten to fifteen repetitions in three sets if possible.<br><br>Now these are quite literally just to maintain your body, you won't gain much mass or strength but you will retain stamina and should help alleviate the lack of calorie burn from normal activity. Of course if you have dumbbells of some sort I would advise the usual at home exercises, overhead presses, deadlifts and so forth. I can go into more details if it's requested but you probably already know what you need to if you have a set at home. For all these exercises do remember, if unsure of technique feel free to do it in a mirror or check for videos of it being done to ensure your doing it correctly and not risking injury.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">We have covered the body. What of the mind. What of the spirit. It is easy in these times to become despondent, our battle alone can already be taxing upon the soul of even the strongest of Men, when he is taken away from his "normal" life and thrust into deliberate isolation, well, it can be challenging to say the least. A Man alone can spend too much time stewing on things, can find himself constantly staring into the abyss of this dire modern world and find himself sapped, that drive to continue fighting slowly replaced with a desperate need to escape the wounds this degenerate culture inflicts upon his soul. We have all seen these pathetic, sad and vacuous creatures that compose our "cultural elite" doing their pathetic little videos on their chosen video platforms or on social media at the moment, be they some sad used up whore or semitic parasite trying to gain notoriety by reminding the world that they do indeed still exist and how their "just like you". Yes, so like us, why I am sure a great many of us enjoy defiling the innocent and whoring ourselves for a brief moment of fame within the tribal media. Such joy they bring. Or perhaps you've been subjected to the incessant applause for medical operatives akin to my delightful little island, where droves of middle aged buffoons open their front door for their allotted four minutes of applauding as the television told them to. Now yes we do isolate ourselves from this as much as possible but the realisation that this is the current reality does still have a detrimental effect upon the mind. We observe their forced adherence to idiotic practices and yearn for an actual real community rather than the media enforced facsimile we are forced to observe upon occasion. <br><br>We all seek true companionship you see, true brotherhood, especially in a time like this where the potential for a crisis is ever present. It is daunting to believe that should we struggle at this time no one will be there for us. This feeling only grows stronger when we are deliberately *forced* into this isolation through circumstance, not through choice. Things prey on our mind in isolation, do I have enough x, y or z, if I get ill who will look after me, what if this is the prelude to the state finally cracking down on us. All these things have crossed my mind, I may have a family however I am their protector in a time of many unknowns, many have similar fears albeit in a different way. In a time of crisis I have almost no one I could turn to or ask to fight by my side. This is true for most of us, the loss of our brotherhood a grave wound to the European soul. It is why posts like <a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#78827">&gt;&gt;78827</a> sadden me genuinely. Not because of some sense of pedantic sympathy but because this is the reality for far too many of our people. I hesitate to call you by your ID but you and many others in this thread have posted here from the start and have demonstrated that you indeed are good Men, Men deprived of what is yours by right, same with all who have frequented anywhere seeking truths free of semetic manipulations, all Men seeking more. I do not say this to give some simplistic sense of hope or friendship but as a fundamental truth, we seek all the same thing, our people and our futures back. No one reading this who believes in our cause, no one whose heart remains true to his ideals, to his people and to his soil should have to suffer the indignities and the attacks that we have. The insidious creatures responsible have taken so much and now as we are forced into isolation we find ourselves atomised more than ever before. We find ourselves alone more than before. The wounds inflicted with it's normal operation are magnified when we are forced to dwell upon them due to silence and loneliness. Therefore I say to those who find themselves falling into shadow, who are finding darkness filling their hearts and misery filling their mind, do not despair. This time, as have dark times before, *will* pass. You are not alone, you are not abandoned even in this time. You are not forgotten.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Consider this also. If you were would I continue to make these posts? I know my audience here is fairly small yet I persist because I genuinely believe in you who takes the time to read these. Would boards like this continue to exist, would those who continue to fight for Europa and all her peoples continue fighting no matter the odds, no matter the horrors and the risks? The parasite sharpens it's knives and prepares for a letting of blood yet we are not relenting are we. It is a fearful thing at this time it is true, some brush off this situation while others find themselves overwhelmed at the prospect of all that is happening. Regardless though many find themselves afraid due to one thing or another. We are afraid as we do not know who will pick us up if we fall, words are all well and good but it does little when one is staring out at a cold unforgiving world alone at the crack of an unknown dawn. Many feel more alone than usual, we do not know who will care for us if we fall ill, who will ensure our homes are kept safe in our absence, who will remember us if we die as moribund as it sounds. Yes, it all sounds very dramatic but realistically this is what a man contemplates when he has too much time on his hands and he is faced with an unknown on top of so many other unknowns. <br><br>So to you who are fearful in this time, to those who are lonely I say this. You are not finished yet. This virus and the situation it presents to us, yes it is disconcerting. It is daunting. But it it nothing compared to what we have faced before. We survived the Spanish flu, which while far slower moving was much more disasterous, we survived winters so harsh men would freeze in their beds, we have fought against foes both within and without, even the challenges of nature herself we survived and stood firm. We shall stand firm through this too. With grit, strength and determination. Our people demand it, your brothers demand it. Yes it is a fearful situation. But the mark of a true Man is a Man who is not stalled by fear but faces it head on, who continues to fight without flinching for he knows come what may he *shall* emerge victorious. So face the isolation, face the fears and the loneliness head on and make yourself their master. Turn that sense of isolation into a sense of fulfillment, read, listen to music, embrace your skills and create. Be true to your blood and your people, demonstrate just what runs within your veins; the blood of Europa. Of Men who braved the darkest nights, who dedicated years to knowledge and learning, who sought physical to balance the intellectual. Who sacrificed all for you to be here today. Now dust yourself off, clear some space somewhere in the house or apartment, improve your physical form to the best of your ability and engorge yourself with knowledge and your true culture. Why this very thread has some pdfs you can enjoy, i'll even make time sourcing new ones upon request. Just cease the despair is all I ask. We will make it through.</div>

That is why for the first time, one of your posts didn't resonate with me: <a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#79409">&gt;&gt;79409</a><br>I've settled for quarantine after coming home from work before it even came into effect, before I was furloughed. This house is empty and peaceful. It's not that I didn't like work. I have to keep myself active in this house just to stay sane. What I don't like is this quarantine situation coming to an end. Governments are actually forced to give a shit about stopping people coming across borders now. I don't have to be surrounded by shitskins in order to make fiat currency to buy my food and pay utility bills. Old jews who lied their asses off about German work camps are dying. I haven't had television there to indoctrinate me for years. I threw that out with the trash a long time ago. I am sequestered away from this multicultural hell, not hearing the parroted jewish agendas of "Iran is the enemy guys" or "hey lets talk about the [fraud] holocaust for the 50 millionth time" or "white guys are bad because I'm fucking retarded and don't know real history". Everything about not having to hear that trash is fucking fantastic. No more being surrounded by everyone who's not indo-European.<br><br>As for exercise since some might have limited space, this regimen before bed works for me: Laying down (carpeted or doormat), 50 bicycle kicks, 50 situps, 50 times pulling your knees in. Then 50 push-backs, I guess you'd call them, as you lay on your back you're using upper arms to raise yourself, and 50 normal pushups. That's all I feel I need. Also as most are going to be sitting watching likely mindless garbage "entertainment" during quarantine: You can exercise your biceps by laying one hand flat on your lap, top two fingers extended, touch those two with the other hand's same extended fingers. Then switch so it's the opposite hands. Do this rapidly and you'll feel the burn, especially through a movie. Want more exercise and have shitskin next-door neighbors? Grab the largest fucking object you have and swing it around in the backyard during the day screaming like a madman in full viking beard. Why not? The apes blast their goddamn music after 3:00am and shake the very ground with that bass shit. You don't want to be the indo-European they don't fear. They used to scream at me from their porches. Now they shut their whore mouths. Shitskins are never going to respect indo-Europeans. Before I woke up to the JQ, I tried to be kind to non-whites. I never saw back then how it made perfect sense why that never worked. I am not their people, and they're brainwashed against my people by jewish programming. Their very culture clash from being brought where they don't belong by jews for the interracial mixing agenda means none of us will <strong>ever</strong> fully get along with those not of our race. Be the indo-European they <strong>do fear</strong>.<br><br>I realize this may come across as a schizo post. For those who think so, they don't understand. I was a man backed against the fucking wall by all the degeneracy coming at me and everything besides my house was taken away. I was on the brink of losing my goddamn mind until quarantine. Death glaring shitskins day after day, and yes I do hide my power level. It takes everything I have not to express an outburst and hold back everything I would say here. I find myself extremely pissed off that the Governor of my state is siding with the orange jew POTUS and spouting bullshit that every member of this state wants to get back to work. So they're going to be lifting quarantine, the Governor said within a week. America has the most wide-spread cases of the virus out of every other nation and they want to lift quarantine. Dumb mother fuckers. Well, at least I'll likely catch Covid19 and die on a respirator. Fuck this gay earth.</div>

Rap/hip-hop culture was honed through decades of jewish record producers finding the dumbest mother fuckers and making it look like stupidity is cool. Read the entire article for the distant past. In addition, there has been kikes Edgar Bronfman Jr. of Warner Music Group, Lucian-Grainge of Universal Music Group and Rolf Schmidt Holtz of Sony Music Entertainment.<br><br>When is the last time you saw a black person with class unlike that rich long press-on-nails cunt like Cardi B crying in her cereal because she wasn't able to go to restaurants during quarantine? I'm talking actual fucking class. The self respect to reject the fake jewish manufactured culture of rap and hip-hop, hard drugs, flexing, muh sideways guns, drivebys, crypts and bloods, thug life and ebonics. None of that was ever their actual culture from their native lands.

  <div class="divMessage">What I just explained is why black people piss off some anons on this board. It isn't about skin color. It's not about "muh master race" which jews turned around into a lie against Hitler because he identified <em>them</em> as desiring to be the master race. <strong>It's about being fake as fuck.</strong> When you're spouting ebonics, twerking, throwing up gang signs, shooting families in drivebys and smoking crack, you are not black. You are the shame of your ancestors and an absolute slave of jews. This goes for wiggers as well. Traitors deserve no empathy. I have unindoctrinated black people simply because I've been surrounded by them in public. Far fewer than other indo-Europeans yes, but I've done it. Everyone needs to break free of jewish programming.</div>

I'm learning German myself, and when learning any language I would recommend engaging in passive input, basically watch a movie, series or videos in whatever  your target language is.<br>Finally I'd recommend starting a diary, it has help me arrange my thoughts, and ponder on my actions and growth.</div>

The left-over from taking care of their utility bills would've left me with enough rent for a small apartment. I even choked my disgust down, tried not to throw up, and contacted the twerkers+ebonics speakers. They were too dumb to figure out how to follow through. In a full year, I had two visitors. One was upset the entire house wasn't furnished. That's his fucking job to buy the rest of the furniture. Another was upset there wasn't exercise equipment. This is not a gym.

Where every fucking day there's some hooting negro and a chink screaming in their vile tongue. Hope you chance upon a good tenant soon enough.<br><br><br>Anyways I'll post a meditation guide, it helps clear the mind and relax one quite a bit, some anon was asking for one as well.<br><br>Firstly turn off any possible distraction, like music or tvs. Then sit straight up in any comfortable position, and set up an alarm for the amount of time you want to meditate for, five minutes is a good time to start and gauge how much you can go for.<br>Once all everything has been set up, you can begin, your objective is to think of nothing, empty your mind. <br>Start by concentrating on your breathing, actively thinking "inhale" and "exhale" will help you focus on your breathing even more, and tune out any wondering thoughts or bodily annoyances. Resist as much as you can any urge to scratch anything, or shift positions, after a while they fade just as they came. Internal disturbances should also be ignored. If any pop up, go back to thinking of your breathing, and if it persists, give a quick answer to it so that it can conclude, don't entertain the idea any further, just let it go. Its also not a good idea to beat yourself over any failings during meditation, as this is just another distraction, if you scratched yourself or shifted positions then that's it, go back to focusing on breathing, same for entertaining thoughts.<br><br>Eventually you'll be able to meditate without having to think about your breathing, instead you can focus on the sensations present in your body, on the feeling of air coming in and out of you, your heartbeat or some kind of abstract visualization, a common one is an expanding sphere which follows your breath.<br>Once you get the hang of it, increasing the time the next step, add an extra minutes, maybe two, do this whenever you think the alarm sounded too early, or when you kept meditating despite the alarm going off. Eventually you'll find that the alarm sounds too early too often, and you can get into it easier.<br><br>I'm not an expert by any means, I only started because I saw some shitty image some years ago, but this my advise, and I'd welcome any further advise.</div>

Hopefully normal routine will re establish itself within the coming weeks and work can continue normally.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#79414">&gt;&gt;79414</a><br>It is in no way a schizo post, do not demean yourself by using that term. In a time of turmoil it is better to be honest and true rather than dismissive. Your attainment of solitude is an enviable thing for despite the common idea that we must all be constantly "connected" solitude presents peace, a chance for reflection. What I speak of is not the isolation of living alone but the isolation of being divided from those who share greater ideals and greater goals, those one can depend upon in questionable times, my regret comes not from socialising generally but how few still maintain some semblance of morality or even sanity that can be considered true kin that can be relied upon. One need merely share polite small talk with family to realise just how lost people are in this epoch. Yes, it is true not everyone has grand ideas or understand concepts beyond the rudimentary but our people are hollowed out, drones reciting the usual diatribe of simple buzzwords or tedious drivel concerning some mundane media figure. Where as those seeking more, those fighting for a greater cause who try to approach others of our ilk are scorned, nay harried and rejected for caring of their future. My regret comes from you, a Man who understands like so many here how grim our battle is has no immediate kin to share that burden for the semetic media has informed all in sundry that we are nought but "hateful beasts" despite the craven and disgusting actions of the parasite right in front of their eyes. Of course they cannot be blamed for they are simple people and the parasite is cunning but it can be an isolating feeling. I wish to try dispel this feeling for those who feel it. It is heartening to hear of your resilience and your balance in handling it none the less and your attitude to it is, despite your claim of sounding "schizo", well balanced. But not all handle it so well sadly. Some fall to despair and misery, we must lift them from this now more than ever.<br><br>You also maintain an excellent physical regime if you don't mind me saying by the way, maintenance of such a high level of fitness during this period is of absolute importance.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#80115">&gt;&gt;80115</a><br>Anything that supports our kin is always welcomed in this thread, feel free to post anything useful. This is a place for brothers and thusly no kin who wish to help shall be turned away. We are in this together.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#80157">&gt;&gt;80157</a><br>You are most gracious, thank you for your kind words. You are quite right on maintaining connections and allies in this dark period, especially with the current escalation not merely with COVID but with the African golems being roused by the semite. It feels very odd how recent events are transpiring and needless to say it would be prudent for us all to keep tabs. What occurs in America can very easily spill beyond, I believe there were even "protests" (or rather angry looting negroids and degenerative self loathing whites) in central London joining in a "sympathy" protest today. A stage is being set, for what I can only make rudimentary assumptions at.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#80298">&gt;&gt;80298</a><br>I've some local copies made but there is also <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://archive.is/t6VbN.">https://archive.is/t6VbN.</a> I also have all books in a 7zip file in the event of loss of attachments. In the event of catastrophic loss of the site or the board please do not hesitate to repost any and all posts made where you see fit, it is absolutely vital that no matter what transpires our people find purpose beyond the factional groupings of the "alt right" and the despicable trappings of the semetic modern media. It is our duty beyond all else to fight for our people, anything that can give them hope must be shared freely.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Oh, to Hell with it. Tonight's subject is one of seeking a purpose beyond what is offered. A topic many find themselves seeking yet never quite grasp. That of the topic of Faith.<br><br>Faith is a mercurial thing at times. For some Men it comes as easy as breathing, Faith within Christ, within Woden, even Faith in their own people. It is easy for them for they see the beauty and truth within their Faith. It grants unto them strength untold, bravery unmatched. Yet for some it is like sand falling between their fingers, their minds eternally searching, seeking yet never quite grasping at it. They can spend a lifetime wandering, never finding a truth that truly fits. Yes, there are those of a closed mind, those who reject anything beyond the material√© but they are some of the most ardent supporters of this current age, men who act akin to children, desiring nought but their TV shows, chemical laden foods and "adult collectables". Hollow men, empty men for whom nothing will ever truly sate their physical and spiritual hunger. <br><br>What many often fail to realise is that Faith itself is one of the single greatest drivers for a man. A belief, an understanding not simply of the Divine but of something that is beyond their own existence. Many hearken back to the proverb concerning planting trees under whose shade we shall not sit but it is something even beyond that. Faith is part of a legacy that stretches back far beyond even our own understanding be it the legacy of Christ and his raising of the human spirit or the legacy of Woden and his sharing of language with mankind or even the legacy of a great leader lifting his people from misery and degeneracy. It is a belief in the supranatural, the realm where Men achieve greatness that can seem impossible to some (not the supernatural which in popular terms mostly concerns the purely mystical). It is this belief in those we hold to be true examplars that true Men seek to emulate. Does not the truly pious Christian seek to not merely be kind and charitable but to also wield the sword in defense of his faith? Does the true Pagan not seek to reject the semetic trappings of this age and find both peace and challenge with a more truer existance? Does not the Man who wishes to emulate the heroes who fought for our people reject both Communism and uncontrolled Jewish capitalism both in equal measure? Men such as these do not do it for spectacle or to be recognised for these actions, they do it for that is their true purpose, their true calling. No one will remember the name of a single follower of Christ who lived a truly honest life and defended his faith yet he does not do it for recognition, he does it because he finds the strength to do so in his belief. In his Faith. A Pagan who tends a grove and makes treks to ancient sites will not have his name recorded upon the very stones he tends yet he does so for it is demanded of him. A Man emulating our fallen Heroes does not do so for recognition for he knows should it become public he will face scorn, he does so for he considers it his duty to ensure those heroes are never forgotten. This, in essence, is faith. It is an unbreakable bond between Man and a greater ideal. Consider for a moment. Charlemagne did not forge his empire for his own merit, he did not charge and fight for his own glory. He fought because his Faith told him he was right. There was no shades of grey, there was no question, he fought for his Faith was strong enough that no matter what may come he knew he was doing the work of the Divine. The children of Odin when they explored and fought they did not do it simply for personal glory but for a chance at fighting the final battle in the realm beyond, a chance at honouring their ancestors by demonstrating they were capable of doing so. When in 1933 when Hitler rose to power it was not for his own glory nor for his own goals but for his people, for the German people he stood, his faith in them unwavering unto the last. Faith drove these men, Faith in something greater.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Of course the simple mind will always reject such ideas, "no way man, if Christ was real then why'd his sky daddy let him die rofl btfo christcuck" or "pagans got fukked by christians u larping faggot" or the classic "if u love your dictator so much why dont u kill urself and join him". Of course such pathetic creatures will shame you, they have no true understanding beyond the mundane, beyond their own carnal pleasures. They have no Faith in anything real. Oh but do not misunderstand them though, they do have a form of it, a much more pathetic and simpler form. Faith in their material possessions. In their football teams (both soccer and American football), they have faith the media will always tell them the truth or that "Trump will build the wall any minute now, you just wait". They have a mutated form of Faith, a hijacked one, warped to suit the needs of the despicable creatures that maintain their stranglehold upon the European peoples at home and in the colonies. These foul creatures revel in it, their "art" such as "piss Christ", their abominations of chemically castrated creatures being presented as just normal people like you and I, they revel in the rejection of the true and anything that represents something greater than their own vile ideals and in turn present only the material and the degenerative. It is only within the rejection of their proferred poisons, only within the refusal to debase ourselves with their lies and machinations that we can truly find faith again.<br><br>It is down to each of us individually to find an exemplar of the true ideals of our people be it Christ, Woden or even one of the many great leaders who fought for our people. We must grow to understand them, to realise for what they fought, be it our eternal souls, a chance at standing at the final spiritual battle of Ragnarok or even the chance of one day forging a nation of hope based upon National Socialism or even Fascism, it comes down to us to embrace these things. To embody them. You needn't even embody just a single one of them, Christianity works well within National Socialism as evidenced from the history of that time, Paganism even found a revival under it to a degree, we must learn to cease rejecting these things for they are indeed truly ours. Christianity was forged within the European image, it holds European ideals, Paganism was formed of our blood and our land, our political ideals before the parasite offered corrupted modern "democracy" was truly ours so we must embrace these to our hearts. We must find succor in them, learn from them. Understand the teachings of Christ, seek older texts prior to the Jesuits corruptive teachings, seek ancient Pagan lore, read correct translations of Mein Kampf and the books of those who fought for us. Understand them. Embody them. Fight for them. For they represent us, they represent our people. <br><br>In an age where atomisation is all we know, where misery and treachery reign supreme, it can be hard to believe in something can't it. It can be a struggle. You want to believe, you want to find something beyond this but with the darkness so prevalent what is the point. We feel alone. Forgotten. The claws of the parasite dig even harder into our flesh, the pain clouds the mind as we desperately seek to escape the pain and the sadness. We all have felt it, some feel it still. But you must understand something vitally important. They *want* you to feel that pain, to feel clouded and confused, to seek escape into all the paths they can usher you in to. They wish you to go into mainstream Catholicism, to accept the degenerative child molesting priests which the Pope embraces. They wish you to go into modern "Paganism" with all the pedantic mockery of Wiccan ideals and ridiculous ideas such as singular Goddess worship. They wish you to seek heroes in weak puppets such as Jordan Peterson and Carl Benjamin or as he's more commonly known Sargon of Akkad. They wish you to fall in line, to be herded into the pen like good little cattle.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">You, we, shall not. We must reject all proferred poisons, all puppets and pretenders they march before us. Christ would not demand you offer fealty to the invader nor the Jew so how dare they demand we do. Woden would not demand we despoil our lands for capital or the invader so why should we believe he and the Gods would ask us to do this now. The fallen heroes of the last "great" war would not demand we surrender to our hated foes so why in the name of Europa would we do so now. No. No we must reject them all, we must find strength in true Heroes, true Men and examples of what *we* are both in the physical and spiritual, what we the European people truly are. We are not slaves, we are not puppets to be used to entertain the foul parasite, we are Men, Men of Christ, of Woden and of Europa. We are brothers one and all and we shall never surrender. So fight for them, let them lend you their strength, let them grant unto you the Will to stand against all that comes, against the shadows and the nightmares that will assail us. We are mightier than they could ever know for Men with Faith in their hearts cannot be broken, cannot be bought or made slaves. <br><br>I believe the following words are a good reminder of just what Faith in a greater ideal can achieve. Remember them well for they echo just what strength Faith can bring.<br><br>"Yes, Germany was back then a democracy, before us, and we have been plundered and squeezed dry. No. What does democracy or authoritarian state mean to those international hyenas? They don‚Äôt care at all. They are only interested in one thing: Are you willing to be plundered? Yes or no? Are you stupid enough to keep quiet in the process? Yes or no? And when a democracy is stupid enough not to stand up, then it is good. But when an authoritarian state declares, ‚ÄòYou are not going to plunder our people neither from the inside nor the outside' then that is bad.<br><br>In reality, money rules in these countries (‚Äúdemocracies‚Äù). They talk about press freedom, when in fact all these newspapers have one owner, and the owner is, in any case, the sponsor. This press shapes then public opinion. These political parties do not have any differences at all, like before with us. You already know the old political parties. They were all the same.<br><br>Then these people must think that especially in these countries of freedom and wealth, there should exist a very comfortable life for its people. But the opposite is the case. In these countries, in the so-called democracies, it's people is by no means the main focus of attention. What really matters is exclusively the existence of this group of ‚Äòdemocracy makers.‚Äô That is, the existence of a few hundred giant capitalists who own all the factories and shares and who, ultimately, lead the people. They are not interested at all in the great mass of people. They are the only ones who can be addressed as international elements because they conduct their business everywhere. It is a small, rootless international clique that is turning the people against each other, that does not want them to have peace.<br><br>They can suppress us. They can kill us if you like, but we will not capitulate!"<br><br>Hail our people.</div>

As I've said before, Christianity (Codex Sinaiticus-Greek) was stolen and co-opted by the the jewish parasites. They have no evidence whatsoever that even the Old Testament was originally theirs. Fraudulent translations mean nothing. The oldest hard evidence being the Septuagint (also in Greek). "jew" is a term later inserted through translations which never used it before. And so the kikes claim Greek translated Hebrew, with not a single shred of hard evidence. The same as the fraudulent book of Esther claiming a kike princess married Xerxes, the only things kikes are capable of inventing is intellectual theft. Volkische as well thrived under the Third Reich. That is Paganism and oneness with nature and the natural order. As your posts imply, one does not need to reject the other. Division is the tool of the enemy.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Hey. Sorry for bumping an old thread, but I'm a literal mental retard (Parkinson's), and I'm wondering if anyone knows any tips or tricks to get back on the upward path of self-improvement? I feel trapped in the mind and body of a sheeple, and it's only by constantly watching videos such as Adolf Hitler's Warning and The Jews Are Our Misfortune that I can manage to stay in a redpill mindset instead of slipping back into the bluepill slime of hating Adolf Hitler. My attention span and memory are like that of a goldfish, but I'm determined to reach back the heights that I once had. I don't really know or have the capacity to remember what caused it, but I think my kike psychiatrist sensed my power level, so he deliberately prscribed me way too many fucking anti-psychotics. I'm NEET right now, and I'd hate to waste this golden opportunity of self-improvement.</div>

I watched that guy's video, and one comment stated he committed suicide in 2017. Unfortunate, since there's nothing wrong with him. He had an <em>auditory</em> memory. I have that exact same issue he described where I don't picture anything. Blank mind. I also see darkness when I close my eyes (who doesn't?). <em>I don't dream</em>. I've had this my whole life. I read aloud and retain memories that way. Yet in the 80s, it was diagnosed as "ADD" and prescribed Ritalin. That doesn't mean he, you or I could not function or recall memories.  Listening to him talk, his ability to describe 'Blank Mind' contradicts what he's saying. The syndrome does not exist. It's unnecessary panic. Depersonalization Disorder was not known as anything other than sensory change until the kike Sigmund Freud corrupted the concept, as jews tend to do with history. You can endure this difficult memory issue by learning through hearing and not panicking over your lack of visual memory.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Okay, so I see now what is going on. My parents have been secretly giving me lithium over the past couple of years. Or perhaps some equivalent? I have aweful memory memory loss, and difficulty with basic logic. Also, I don't know for sure, but I am paranoid that they might put me in a mental institution in the near future. Does anyone have any reccomendations for the event that I end up in some resididential psychiatric ward type shit? I'm talking stuff like convict conditioning style body building to dissuade someone from injecting me with vaccines or sedatives, how to deal with sociopathic or jewish staff, eventual escape plans if it comes to that, etc. I have no way of knowing if I'll have access to the internet, or if I do I can be sure that they'll have either some heavy duty surveillience (overt or covert) of what I research, some pavlovian "good goy points" system of earning time on the computer, or both.</div>

Either way, you need to get out from under the heel of your parents and don't trust psychiatrists. Never trust kikes, period. They can only check you into an institution if you're proven to be a harm to yourself or others. Don't be. I guess if you suspect your parents enough, don't ingest what they give you.

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/79938.html#81315">&gt;&gt;81315</a><br>I've spoken to many Communists, trying to break them of their conditioning. Maybe you don't see them as frequently in whatever nation you're in other than the U.S. The movement is still a subversive element here. It's shilled in Universities, as there are many jewish professors. I was forced to study Marxism at Uni or fail so wrote sarcastic papers. Trying to have a conversation and convincing a Commie one on one that their ideal is the evil one hasn't worked. They don't care. I've seen these idiots spout they hope for "Russian disinfo" (they don't accept Bolshevism was jewish) and the redefining of words is one of their primary goals. These same types will recommend jewish authors and philosophers to you endlessly without even realizing they're brainwashed. Bring it up, "you're anti-semitic! you're such a raycis!" This type is European descended, yet raves about "systemic racism of white peepo". Even daring trying to suggest they're racist towards their own ends up with them shrieking how could they be "since they are white". "What, do I hate my own mother? My own family?" Of course they don't. But their minds are corrupted.<br><br>The kind who cry about "violence of the Alt Right" as "white" when it's clearly jewish. The type who don't know the difference between a Trump supporter, a National Socialist or any other European descendant who respects their heritage. The faggots who shriek about "white privilege" while insulting their own people with "redneck" and "trailer trash", never realizing they're admitting that means poverty - the complete opposite of "privilege". "It's ok to be white" is racist according to them. "All lives matter" is racist to them because it's not just "black lives matter". During all this, they'll try to shill "race not real" which completely contradicts everything they stand for. When provided, the overwhelming amount of blacks who have murdered European descendants based on race, overwhelming numbers of black crime and the murder of black police officers doesn't fit their "racist white cop" narrative. Also with photographic and video violence of Antifa, they'll either sidestep or backpedal.<br><br>The Marxist's primary responses to countering arguments have been "you're cherry picking!" or "you're trying to trap me!" They're emotional brainlets, which is why they latch onto Communism in the first place. Even after you hear the Marxist agree on some lines of how falsely villified this white label is, they'll still spout insults against "white people" from their dumb trained minds. Hitler was able to convert Communists in Germany due to speaking truth without allowing them to interject in meetings the way they were allowed in their Commie groups. Communism is such a subversive element, only herd mentality seemed to work to break them. As he stated, they weren't convinced at first but did go home with something to think about. Back then in Germany, millions of Commies came to the side of National Socialism. Commie seats diminished in the Reichstag and their votes switched parties to the NSDAP gradually over 13 years.<br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://genius.com/Adolf-hitler-chapter-7-the-conflict-with-the-red-forces-annotated">https://genius.com/Adolf-hitler-chapter-7-the-conflict-with-the-red-forces-annotated</a></div>

I don't particularly mind it as we all have our duty in such cases but it can be fairly draining. I do have a couple of topics I would like to post but I don't feel like they are complete, they still feel lacking. I try not to post unless I have truly something to give so my radio silence isn't abandonment of the thread but rather a lack of satisfaction with what I do have. Though in saying that there is one close to completion, I just don't know how to finish it. It has to do with how we see ourselves in our own journey, how to recapture that feeling of a greater purpose, that vital element that has forever been the hallmark of the European Man. I just need that feeling of vitality to complete it, this Corona situation has made me lethargic and a lethargic body creates a shiftless mind. I do apologise though, I began this thread and while all are welcome to shape it and create it I have been neglectful in helping fill it myself. As way of righting that wrong once I complete the topic i'll update with a slew of more books concerning our culture and history, I've been collecting since the last book posting so there's a few more I can add to the existing list.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">How do you anons keep pushing forward when having very rough times in life? I recently have had a difficult time when some unexpected events just happened very suddenly recently, and I'm having trouble maintaining a decent, positive attitude and wanting to keep going forward. I feel like checking out mentality, and maybe also physically. The only thing that seemed to keep me together was maintaining the mindset where I try to figure out what priorities and tasks are more important to fix at the moment, and then set out to complete it. Other than that, I feel my strength and will draining every hour.<br><br>On top of that, my family doesn't seem to care react too much to my current situation. They did help me as much as they can, but I get the feeling that they view me as the black sheep of the family, the one who is a disappointment and a failure, and helping me seems like a burden to them. I know many anons stress to maintain strong friend and family ties during current modern times, but my family doesn't feel like a traditional happy family that ever else seems to have, and I can't seem to connect with anyone else except in the chans. When I do some self-reflection, I seem to have low self-esteem and view and value myself negatively. I do consider myself as a disappointment, and I feel very much alone. Finding a support group in meatspace is a difficulty. The only solution I see is to self-improve mentally and focus on my career choices and financial situation, before making physical attempts like working out and strict diets. But I do feel my will draining from me to even want to continue forward.<br><br>I know there are some anons who have had situations even worse than mine, but I still feel like I can't continue. If any anon has suffered very stressful and difficult times, how did you pull yourself back together and keep going? Or if it was someone else, how did they pull themselves back together and keep pushing forward? Right now, my priorities have shifted to making sure I have a solid stable life financially and career wise, before doing any other /pol community building and activities in meatspace.</div>

This grim year has presented greater challenges than any of us could of foreseen prior, an escalation of unbound proportion that has placed not just ourselves but our families and the world at large in a far more tenous position. We live in a world where morality, nobility and honour lay dead, in their place degeneracy, degeneration and horror. By not succumbing to it you *are* the black sheep, you *are* the failiure namely because you feel the stirring of something deeper within you. How do I know this? You mentioned you prioritise aspects of your life, you explore methodology of self improvement and analyse career choices in an age where all avenues innevitably lead to servitude to a system that despises you on a fundamental level. It does not see you as a Man, it sees you as a cog, a financial unit upon which it can feed as it utilises you. This system, this vile creation of ursery and affliction has but one goal; to strip you of all that makes you You. It is of no wonder a gentlemen like yourself feels such a gloaming darkness hanging over you for all of us live in an age of misery. 4272e9 is indeed right in pointing out that the parasite yearns for our destruction for it has left none of us with any avenue in which to truly live. To truly find happiness. Consider this, in an age where ursery, the rape of eight year old white children and the murder of the innocent is considered the "new normal" it is better to be the black sheep than to be embraced by such a foul and corrupt entity that this modern world has become. There is the old maxim of "I was born in the wrong age", truly for any sane and just man that is indeed the case.<br><br>But not all is lost, upon that you have my word. Consider for a moment the misery you feel, consider just *why* it has been thrust upon you. Just *why* your family sees you as the black sheep. You clearly seek more than the material, you clearly seek the things our people once took for granted, a home, a career that is satisfying, a future that is secure. Such things are anathema in this climate, such things are dangerous, you would likely find more acceptance if you came out as some child molesting homosexual than simply uttering the phrase of "I want to be free" for the world and your family cannot understand the sentiment, it has been told not to. Embrace the negro. Celebrate the homosexual child predator parade. Clap for the destruction of your history. These things are publicly acceptable to the simple masses for what else do they know. Oh, they may utter under their breath "fuck niggers" or "fuck fags" but they lack the bravery to reject it fully in their lives. It is that same oppression that you are feeling now, it is a grim backdrop to the theatrical misery that is the modern world.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">The thing is though you fail to realise that if you were truly weak, if you were truly worth nothing and that you were a failure then such a thing would not affect you. Consider, how many worthless fools and cowards just coast through life, how many just idle by, never achieving, never doing anything of worth no matter how small. These small people, these drones, they have no realisation concerning greater goals or greater ideals where as by your post demonstrate you do have this understanding. This already elevates you above most, their simpler spirits being content with merely existing comfortably. You have awareness thusly you are troubled. What you must realise however is that all troubles are transitory. Oh, indeed by grim happenstance our own worlds can begin collapsing in the blink of an eye, the death of a loved one, a betrayal by one you hold dear, a financial debt you didn't even know you had accrued. This in the best of times would be a burden but with the backdrop of gloaming shadows we live in now that same burden becomes far heavier. Where once you would of merely had to strain your back now by the sheer force of events it pins you to the floor, your body near paralysis as you grasp in the dirt trying to find something to pull yourself forward with. The key to rising once more is two fold. One, you must lighten your burden. Your analytical approach is quite correct but your best bet is to start small. Look at the lightest weight you have, the lightest burden and solve it first as in most circumstances they are the quickest. Even if it is tangled within other burdens lift it anyway and proceed to the best of your abilities. Now that is not to say you will be able to lift all the burdens upon you, all of us will carry some until we breathe our last but that is where the second aspect comes in. That of strengthening yourself.<br><br>You speak of having low self esteem and being drained, both are interconnected. I would argue your focus on career and finances over self improvement is part of that vicious cycle. Yes, both aspects of your life are vital, especially if we are to survive long enough in this dying and decrepit system of ursery and corruption. But they must also be balanced with yourself as well. A Man with low self esteem will rarely achieve much, his mind clouded by self doubt and fear. His feet will fail him, his soul weakens for no resolve can be found. You must not neglect such things. Especially now as the darkness hangs over us. Think of it like this. You are a son of Europa, you are an inheritor to her soil both of the homelands and her colonies. You are born from it, shaped in ways unfathomable by your people and the land they made their own. But that soil must be fertile for new life to grow, it must be made arable. Now the semite, it salts the earth, it's poisons it allowing only weeds and deformed life to bloom. The soil must be refreshed, the poison washed away and given new life. In doing so fresh life, nature itself can find purchase again and grow unbound and unbowed. You are that soil. Your self doubt and fear of familial rejection is the poison poured into you by this semetic influenced world. You will achieve little without fixing that part of yourself, without fixing the Man who stands in the mirror every morning. Do not misunderstand me though, you need not be handsome, you need not be the smartest nor the wisest, you need not be covered in rippling muscle from head to toe. But you must recognise the areas in yourself which you have failed in and fix them before some semblance of strength can be found. You must plant your roots deep in the soil and become unbending, unyielding. Then the challenges of this miserable age, they will begin to grow pale and smaller as you realise you indeed have the strength to face them and you do indeed have that strength within you.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">You recognise the world is ill, you recognise you are being drained and you recognise a solution is needed. That solution is already present, it is you, it is upon your shoulders to lift yourself up. You are no filth ridden third worlder scrabbling in the dirt and defecating in the street, you are no negroid who sustains itself by theft and engorges itself on violence, you are a Man of Europa. You are the son of creators, of builders, of heroes and of Men who challenged the world itself. In your blood runs all these aspects, in your blood is the history of your people that will forever stay with you. So get up off your knees, lighten your burdens and embrace the strength within yourself. I know though these can seem to be merely words, merely pleasant ideals espoused by a brother on distant shores. So mayhaps i'll share some of my own feelings for once. Mayhaps I can help you understand why I believe you can indeed endure.<br><br>Like you I have watched my nation die an ignoble death. I have learnt of it's sins and the destruction we have wrought upon brothers under the lies of the parasite. This alone weighed heavy on me for some time, darkness filled my thoughts from dawn to dusk but this I spoke upon previously. What I did not speak on though was my child. As a crescendo to this existing fear I had, my young son was diagnosed with a particular issue that would forever cause him to struggle, that would mean he especially would be at risk when I am gone. It broke me to a deep degree. I looked upon the world with despair, seeing the fraying of it's fabric and found myself lost in the shadows of this epoch, the idea that my son would be easy prey for the nightmares that will come after I am gone. A part of me yearned to end it, the pain broke me. I could nary talk to my love nor my family about it for I feared they would never understand, never grasp just how terrified I was. I had little money, being his carer alone as his mother fell into post natal depression I had no income beyond a small government stipend, my career sacrificed to ensure both could be cared for. I'd never felt so alone and isolated before in my life. I wanted to die. I grew fat and lazy, trying to block out the world, running from it, just wanting to escape it all. I say this not for sympathy nor for recognition but to let you know that the darkness lifts, that even the most dire of situations can be overcome. Do you know what got me through it? It will sound silly to you but a simple /sig/ thread on 8chan. Sounds daft doesn't it. I would lurk, following events, reading the National Socialist General threads and learning more and more. Oh, now don't misunderstand me, there was still a deluge of idiots of course but in the self improvement general threads I would come across a little gem here and there, a sincere post or bit of advice. It was one phrase that galvanised me though. "No one is coming to save us, we must save ourselves". Quite a simple phrase isn't it. But it stuck with me for some reason, this one phrase stuck with me as I continued to learn of not merely what the parasite was doing to our people but just what was lost as well. In time that despair morphed into anger at first, unfocused rage at the injustice done. But I learnt that the anger if not utilised correctly would destroy me so I used it as a fuel for change instead. I used it to change myself a bit at a time. I wrote about it earlier in the thread, it started small, just little bits here and there. Small steps towards a greater goal. Within the course of several months I had gone from a quiet despair laden fool who wished to surrender all that made me to something better. A Man. The Man I wanted to be. I looked at those who came before us, great Men who tried to forge us a future, finding succor in their ideals and their words then at those singular voices who would sincerely make efforts in those old /sig/ threads and realised that even though I would never know their faces they saved me. A dramatic way of putting it perhaps but true none the less.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">It made me reflect not just on myself but on events at large, the most profound moment for me was this. That I yearn to see the world that could of been had the parasite not played it's game. I yearn to see how far our people could of gone had the shackles of ursery and lies not been forced upon us. I know this is a world I will never see, it is a world that has been denied me. To us. I cannot fight for what never was however I can fight for a world that can be. I can give all I can to whoever I can, grant what strength and hope I have to as many of my kin as my words may reach in the hopes that they too can find the same strength others once gave me. This gift I give freely and gladly for without my brothers before me I would not have the strength of spirit to continue on now. I give all I can because we must lift each other up, now more than ever. Men are needed, Men of honour and nobility, Men who are brave enough to dream the same impossible dream our forefathers once took for granted. A homeland. A future free of lies, ursery and machinations. A world worthy of our people. I care not what other offshoots of humanity do in their homelands, they are not my concern, my concern is only for the betrayed, only for my people. For those who had their future stolen. I know one day like all others I will be nought but dust and bones. But until then, until that day I choose to fight on as we all must as well. We have one life, one chance at doing something worthy. We may live on in Heaven or where ever other spiritual planes reside but we must earn that place of rest justly, we must earn that peace by showing first what we can do in this life. It does not matter if our names and faces are forgotten, what matters is our actions. Those are the things that will echo and not in the semetic name way, those are the things that matter. We do not fight on for accolades nor prestige, we do not fight on for recognition nor money. We fight on for our people, we give all we can for our people. So they can have the future that was denied to us. So they never have to fear for their future, so that they can build all the things we never could. So they may never know the sorrows we have known. That is what matters. I know I won't live to see such a thing. But I shall do all I can to make sure as many of us get there as possible, even if it but one voice in a small corner. As long as one person finds hope in my words then when I finally fall I shall fall with pride in my heart for that is all I want. To know I made a difference, no matter how small. That I helped my people. That is all any of us can ever ask for. <br><br>You are not alone. None of us are. Our faces and voices may never be known to each other but we all stand for the same thing, we all fight on in this dying world so we can build something anew together. Mayhaps one day we may relinquish our masks and embrace each other as brothers should upon the shores of our homelands, mayhaps we won't get that chance. But our sons will. Our children will. That is what matters now. That we survive and keep pushing even in the smallest way so that our actions, our resistance to this vile age bears the fruit of hope that can sustain them when we are gone. You are part of that hope. All of us have been degraded by this nightmare we live in, all of us have been wounded by the beast that is the modern semetic Western culture. But those wounds heal, your wounds heal. So carry that weight. Deny the parasite it's victory over you, carry it and walk, others will help carry it with you for that is what brothers do but they cannot find purchase on that burden unless you lift it first. Together as one we'll walk together through this nightmare, together as one we'll make it through the night.</div>

Yet still there remain old wiggers who never let go of their stupidity, others have overcome.

  <div class="divMessage">Hello, I have struggled with porn addiction since I was young. Ever since then it was unlikely for me to go a week without the full PMO cycle.<br>In recent history I tried a nofap timer to count the days that I lasted and made it to about day 9, and crashed hard.<br>However, as of today I have gone ~15 days without climaxing. Yes, I know, don't watch porn, don't masturbate. I am a man of unsteady will so this has been a bit of a challenge for me.<br>I figured I would take it one step at a time, slowly un-building it as I go. My first step was to remove the climax. My understanding of this is that whenever you climax, it sends a shot of dopamine to your brain, so I figured that if I remove that final "hit" then it would ease back the other urges, and it has. For the past few weeks I was still on the PM part of the cycle, but wouldn't allow it to reach O. Due to this, the urge to watch porn and masturbate has been greatly reduced. Removing that final big hit of dopamine has made a huge difference. Without it, the slow flow of dopamine during the PM has been undercut.<br>Since I have reached the goal of cutting the O out of PMO, the other two are much more manageable and resistible.<br><br>At this point I feel like the hard part has passed and that I'm more in control now, and that's not to mention the benefits of semen retention for 15+ days.<br>Maybe this can help someone else, cut out the climax (the end goal of masturbation) and it becomes a meaningless endeavor. No reward = no justification for effort.</div>

After climaxing I always felt like shit and guilty. This guilt was for several reasons, the main ones being of the nature that: jews produced it with the intention of using it to drain me of my willpower. They used real white women, which to me is just bad for countless reasons. Those women could have been mothers of white children. etc. The Net negative of the entire endeavor of porn is subconsciously tugging at me. So, it made me feel guilty. as it should.<br>So with that, I don't feel the emotional burden that comes with the PMO cycle.<br><br>I've noticed that I have more get up and go. It's easier to keep myself and my home clean, I just do it now as opposed to it being a weekly chore before.<br>It's generally easier to do anything that requires even a smidgen of willpower to do. Whereas before I would just sit and numbly stare at the wall, as the thoughts of what I SHOULD do cross my mind, and yet I wouldn't as if my body just wouldn't move, as if the mind to body connection wasn't there.<br><br>Getting out of bed early in the morning is less stressful and less of a challenge, I just don't feel so deeply tired and fatigued, even after a full nights rest.<br><br>It's become easier to focus on things like reading and mentally keeping track of chores and to-do's.<br><br>I feel more alive and alert throughout the day, this has also lead to increased attention from women as I don't look like I'm dead, and I'm generally more sociable now.<br><br>I just feel more contented overall at this point and life doesn't feel like such a hardship as it has in the past. It has become more "my life" than "things I have to do to reach the 'fun' part of my life". I am also more hopeful and don't feel such an overwhelming feeling of despair and anxiety.<br><br><br>I'm sure I could keep going on but these are just some of the things that I've noticed happen in the past few weeks, I have high hopes for the next two weeks and the months to follow.</div>

After my wife left awhile back, I had no desire to jerk it. I haven't even been familiar with masturbation for years anyway. I noticed after no release with a woman, yes energy does return and you're less tired but for me it's also an increasing tension. Rage. Strength as well, I suppose. The hardest part about no sexual release is the problem of not grabbing the nearest shit talking fuckface and punching them until they're spitting blood. These goddamn condescending nigger whores and spics who give me the evil eye and hate me because of my light skin. Even when the retarded beaners have a white parent and light skin of their own, they're separate. In their minds, I'm the enemy. In the minds of some brainwashed displaced Europeans, their own race which I am part of are the enemy because of light skin. All thanks to jewish programming. I labored in my early 20s until I was built, as I saved for higher education. Now I continue to work off that stress at the gym. The problem is, the stronger I become, the more frail those who pass judgment over me are. This isn't a society that respects strength. It's one where weaklings bark at you, like a Chihuahua facing a Doberman. These shaking, tiny retarded bitches get positions of authority because they can get away with insulting the strong. What do I get? The ability to go to prison if I lose it. There was a time when you could hit a weakling and that weakling would learn their place. It makes no difference if I starve myself until I'm emaciated, put on thick black hipster glasses and become one of the weaklings. I'm a straight male of European descent. I'll never be promoted over them. I'm their enemy no matter what. Sure, there is a way. Trannyism through HRT and dick amputation. They seem to forget as long you go that extra mile and fuck yourself up beyond all recovery of what you were before. There's no way I would ever do that, especially just to be a barking chihuahua with delusions of power. Sadly, the jews have turned society around into one welcoming degenerate weakness.<br><br>The answer to the jewish question is not just National Socialism. It's natural Darwinism. Nature has been denied for too long. <em>Weakness must be culled from society</em>.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">So of late the last few topics and the world at large have been somewhat heavy so in light of this, today's topic is a simpler one, one that I believe many of us can use in some form or another; finding joy in creation.<br><br>Let us begin by recognising one of the most vital facets to the European peoples be they in the homelands or the colonies, our ability to create. To shape stone, wood and metals into wondrous, dignified creations, to weave words and musical notes into symphonies for the soul, the creation of the beautiful and the grand has forever been in our blood whether in service to our people or to a higher power. What too often deters our people from creation however is the imposed self judgement latent in this dire epoch, that hawkish nose poking over the shoulder of the mind reciting it's mantra of "you can never achieve greatness" or "you will never be as good as x, y or z". Mayhaps there is a modicum of truth in the statement, mayhaps we will never measure up to the creators of the past. But it is not in that measurement of ourselves to our peers that true beauty and appreciation is found for both can be beautiful at once. In your minds eye imagine a painter. An actual painter, not some charlatan who smears feaces or blots of paint on a canvas and considers themselves a master, instead a true painter of let us say the Romantic style. This young painter creates a simple scene, for the sake of this argument let us say a painting of a river running through a forest. Now this painting, it is not the work of a master nor by an experienced hand but of an artist who poured his love and his soul into this piece. It may be somewhat simplistic, maybe even lacking in technical skill however that is not what makes the piece itself profound. The power of the piece comes from the ardent love put into the work. The hours the young artist sat by this river, the emotions he attempts to convey within the lighting and the very spirit of the piece, this is where the beauty lies. Now imagine a junior Blacksmith, one self taught who learns how to shape metal not by a teacher but within a simply constructed workship within his own abode. He grows in skill slowly, learning as he does, each creation improving over the last. As he pours more and more of his energy and soul into his work his creations become even more beautiful even if lacking the flair of a skilled artisan. The work still speaks of the beauty within it even with the lack of true technical skills, it still speaks of the smiths soul in a way even the most perfectly technically competent piece could not. This is the beauty of creation that is within all sons of Europa, one which must be reignited if we are to remember who we truly are. Let us go back to the artist for a moment. Now the semite, the vile dark soulless parasites of this age who control modern art, we all know what they would say. "It's derivative", "It's too simple", "Where's the "beautiful negress" in European attire sitting by the river?". These "trend setters", these hawkers of misery and degeneration are only too pleased to see such things destroyed and denigrated. Let us be frank you and I, do any here truly believe any person of right mind and soul would truly enjoy creating art to fit within this modern world? To create abominations fit only for a medical file on a patient in a mental asylum? Of course not, it repulses the good and the noble on a fundamental level. So what does the truly creative soul do? Nothing. It does nothing. It rots on the vine, the subtle brush strokes or the graceful litany of a beautiful tongue forever discarded for it does not fit in a world of darkness and vile degradation. The poisoned soul creates the poisoned piece while the noble soul creates the noble work and only one can exist at the forefront at any one time. Sadly in this dire hour the poisonous cultural artifacts are created at an industrial level while the beautiful are shunned and forgotten. It is why now, more than ever before, must each of us rediscover the beauty of creation.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Now of course, there will be naysayers and layabouts, those who are so used to self flagellation that they believe they hold no talent in anything. To them I say you lie. You lie to your brothers and you lie to yourself. Even the most inept of Men have something they enjoy or wish they could attempt. I'll even use myself as an example. As mentioned previously, I grew up in a miserable grey city. A place mostly devoid of greenery, the handful of parks that dotted it slowly losing their appeal as I grew older as diversity and drugs became more prevalent in these places. Where I lived we had a decent sized garden however, a fairly small oasis of life in a lifeless landscape. We even had an apple tree in it, a wizened old thing whose fruit were tart and amazing to cook with. However being a "city boy" I had no interest in nature, no interest in anything beyond my own childish wants and needs. Oh, i'd enjoy the fruits of this fine tree, my grandmother making delightful apple pies served with some home made custard, I could of eaten the entire thing in one sitting had I the opportunity. I enjoyed the smell of the roses in the front garden gently wafting in through the windows in the spring, the sound of the dying leaves rustling in the autumn breeze, nature always bought me peace even in the heart of the diseased metropolis of my childhood. But while I enjoyed these things I took no time to understand them, no efforts to learn how to appreciate or cultivate such things. <br><br>Then twenty years later when I finally decide I wish to recreate that beauty, lo and behold I was clueless. My garden was nought but a mess, the grass almost to my ankles, weeds lining the sides and the paving to my shed so overgrown grass had grown over the slabs. I was, as stated, lacking in my understanding of nature. I remember one of my first port of call was to buy some tulip bulbs and feeling rather eager I immediately planted them. Upside down. In dead soil at the end of the garden. Without airing the soil. As you can imagine my initial endeavors were... shall we say questionable? However, undeterred I maintained my efforts. I purchased several wooden rectangle planters and after a brief stint of research planted some cherry tomato plants and simple (and I should mention fairly resilient) herbs. I learnt more and more as I cultivated them, over time grasping what is required in order to create. It was far simpler and far more enjoyable than I had initially believed. As my efforts bore more and more fruit I began to take both pride and satisfaction in my efforts. I am most certainly not a skilled horticulturalist nor a particularly green fingered individual however the fact I had achieved such a thing, that even someone as inept as I could create not only something pleasant but also practical and in a way beautiful, well I was enthused. It bought me great pleasure to see such things. This is but one example though, and one that while partially serves to provide enjoyment for myself and my family, it is still fairly insular. To truly find joy in creation one must create not just for themselves but for others.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Go back to the imaginary construct I mentioned earlier for a moment, the painter. Imagine that local modern galleries where hawkers sell their demented art were instead filled with creations such as that. Creations made not just for themselves but to capture moments of beauty for all to share. Visions made to lift the spirit of a brother lost to misery, to show our sons and daughters what a world of beauty is beyond their small childlike worldview. Imagine a bookshop not filled with the diaries of angry homosexuals bemoaning the fact their mentally ill ilk are "oppressed" for wanting to molest children, imagine instead of pieces of corrosive Jewish ideals and hatred instead were the words of a nobler generation influenced by actually great Men. Imagine a grocery in place of a supermarket where instead of chemical laden garbage the food on offer was made by your own people for your own people, with care and pride taken at every point from the growing of the ingredients to the careful presentation upon the shelves of a shop that supports a community with both jobs and the removal of Jewish capital with money flowing to kin rather than a foreign tribe. Many say this is a dream, that such a thing cannot happen. I ask you, why can it not? Why *must* we live in a soulless world stripped of joy and creation. If I wished to, I could write some diatribe ridden drivel with "psuedo" right wing talking points aimed at the Trump crowd from a "based Anglo" perspective, milking the unsuspecting boomer and foolish young Republicans with more rubbish to sate their desire for "edgy" material. But I don't. I won't. I write for you instead, for my brothers lost in this miserable age. Would you like to know why I enjoy writing, why I enjoy making these pieces on here, this quiet corner of the internet? As I find joy in it. I find joy in knowing that even in this small way I am creating something for the good of my people as have many others before me. This, this is creation. It is not just my creation but the creation of every individual who takes something from it and leaves something as well.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">I cannot seek validation in this work for in our corner our ways of thinking can often be disparate and varied but it is the feeling of actually helping that grants the soul some give satisfaction, it means the lessons learned from Men greater than I in past times still hold sway over good Men today. It gives hope. Every blow, every word against the parasite, every painting, every creation that stands against this age of horrors that is a creation of the true European spirit is another small beacon of light holding back the eternal night of semetic victory. In the service of our people creation is perhaps the greatest thing, the unquenchable spirit that the parasite keeps failing to destroy. It need not be grand nor world shaking, it need not be graceful nor technically skilled, all it need be is from the European soul, from the racial underpinnings that is our foundation. To touch that part of ourselves, to even stare too deeply into it is daunting, in some ways it could be considered a gift from the divine within ourselves, it is to embrace something intrinsically without understanding it for we are but Men and creativity is ephemeral. Instead we must channel it, let that power of creation flow into us as our forefathers once did, to seek joy within what we ourselves can forge in service to something beyond just ourselves. This is how I found joy again, this is how I found peace, how all of us can find peace in a troubled world. When the bleak world feels crushing for a brief moment all of us can find joy and pride in doing something worthwhile. In service to ourselves. In service to our families. In service to our people. <br><br>But again in the distance I hear you say "why, im one guy i cant do shit". "so what, it wont make a difference". If you surrender yourself so willingly then you already consign yourself to oblivion. You sell yourself into financial and spiritual slavery with nary the slightest bit of resistance. You, you yourself can create. You can find purpose, all Men can. You like all of us can bring hope back to a hopeless age, can show that the spirit of creation still lives, inspire those around you with what you can create. You need not be an artisan or a savant in your field, you merely need be strong. Strong of heart, strong in Will to create new things, to create beauty once more in the lives of those we care for. To show them a better life, to bring to them one of the most important things we have lost; inspiration. Look upon the beauty wrought in the name of our people and in deference to a higher power or ideal, look upon the beauty of Notr√© Dame and tell me you do not see the power of creation within it's incredible carvings and structure, listen to the gentle arrangements of Wagner and Beethoven and tell me you do not feel a stirring deep in your soul, look upon the beauty of Caspar David Friedrichs works and tell me you do not see an indomitable spirit within them, look upon the Sistine Chapel and tell me you do not see true beauty wrought before your very eyes. This, this is the slumbering spirit inside all of us, this is what we can create when we channel it into creation. Call it what you need call it, call it the Divine Spirit, call it the Racial Consciousness, call it Odin's Spirit, the name matters not, what matters is that you feel it, that you awaken it even in it's simplest form. Use it, embrace that drive, that fire to create, bring the fruits of your labors into this miserable world so that Brothers can find power and even healing in it. Greater powers may watch over us and try to guide us but in the physical realm and in this dark hour they can only do so much, it is to each other we must turn if we are to make true change. It is each other we fight for, it is each other we stand for. For our Brothers, for our families and for those who come after us. So create, create and show that beauty can still exist even when all seems lost in shadow. Spit in the eye of the eternal enemy and show it that we cannot be broken.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#82558">&gt;&gt;82558</a><br>Welcome back. Your inspiring messages are always welcome here, especially after a few demoralizing shills that were here between your visits. The Marxist filth University I attended had the option of either Gender Studies or Art 101 to make up enough credits for one of my semesters. I of course chose the latter. Art skill wasn't something I ever manifested before. Neither did a few others attending the course, which was why they were in 101. One who was as Mestizo as the Professor (Mexicans are around 48% indo-European mixed) had been drawing his whole life. The Professor chose not to instruct how to create. Her instruction was only "draw someone else's art work". This absurd woman drew corrupted and demented abstracts herself with hideous visages. Throughout the course, we were told to purchase certain art related mediums. Oil paints, canvases, modeling clay, charcoal pencils, etc. The rest of the class besides one Mexican began not knowing how to draw. We were terrible at it at first. I personally solved the problem through practice and drawing light square grids before (again being instructed to) copy Renaissance paintings grid for grid. My skill as well as the skill of two other displaced Europeans increased over the semester, until we were creating our own designs and graded highly for advancing in the course. The one Mexican who always drew dark, twisted aesthetics never improved and those who weren't descended from Europeans only progressed slightly, aside from one jew in the class whom criticized everyone's art for being "derivative" yet the fool depicted only brown skin drawings as simplistic as what parents hang on their refrigerators from toddlers. <br><br>Thus I can confirm both homeland Europeans and those displaced (without blood tainted by jewry) have latent creative abilities just as you mentioned, and it is true that only self deprecation <span class="spoiler">minus obviously immobility injuries</span> prevents these talents from surfacing. Such shame lumped on the European spirit is from outside sources, often times channeled through brainwashed minds. It is best to shake off the accusations of villainy, uselessness, constant insulting towards our own, racism under the guise of anti-racism (primarily where they insult the blanket label "white"), and point the finger towards those responsible. International jewry is to blame for keeping our talents latent through demoralization. All of this you have more eloquently stated. We tend to be more abrasive across the North Atlantic, but contrary to misheld beliefs, not "greater, more rebellious and freedom-loving". On the contrary, we experience entire lifetimes of trained submission to deceptive indoctrination. One phrase can easily sum up North American life. <em>Coerced obedience to shekeleering and multicultural degeneration.</em></div>

  <div class="divMessage">Posting a bit of a motivational post now. <br><br>Here's a picture of a food server and piece of shit snuff peddler alvin goldstein. Both of these pictures are more similar than you think<br><br>alvin goldtain made his fortune selling filth and ended up losing it all in less than a decade in the early onset of the internet in the 2000s. The internet pretty much killed most if not all porn related industries. He eventually had to get a job as a greeter in a deli and hid in the basement to sleep there since he was literally homeless. This was after he bought a gaudy looking mansion for himself. He got fired when the deli found out he was sleeping in the basement. Before that, he was living in a homeless shelter.<br><br>The lesson to take from this is that people's fortune can change in an instant. Our enemies are well now, but that may not always be the case. Just as trumpie's campaign showed as well, people who are doing well today can be doing horribly tomorrow.<br><br>So always remember to stay motivated /pol/. Nothing in life ever stays static or the same forever.</div>

This board is about revealing kikes' many agendas. National Socialists were able to focus off of the jew when yidds were no longer in power in Germany. Kikes are in power all over the world in this modern day and they influence every negative aspect of our lives. So no, we're not ever going to stop revealing them until they're no longer a threat. What did you actually think I'd start doing in response to this? Begin banning anyone for bringing up jews negatively? Not a chance. The cockroaches are buried in the walls in every institution of influence. Find some other board if you don't like it.</div>

I was raised to respect history as sacred, so I never took the holocaust thing for granted, the more I read about it the clearer it became that it was a big fucking lie. I don't want to become a nationalist that is afraid of being discovered as such, I know jews are afraid of being discovered as jews and I don't think it breeds the kind of men I want for my nation. This is a legit question I'm not trying to shill. Is it because of the society we live in? Maybe because without hiding my power level I would be rendered useless to the current society and wouldn't be able to fulfill my next goals? I don't like putting on a pantomime.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Understanding our forebears and ourselves.<br><br>One of the greatest challenges those of our ilk face at this juncture is balance. So many drift off via pointless political abstractions be it Libertarian, generic Right Wing talking points or nascent pseudo "traditional religious" ideals. Each faction fails in a the key facet of unification and this is what we shall be looking at today. <br><br>Balance in body and spirit, balance in the material and the spiritual is perhaps of the greatest import for those of our ilk. A Man must understand the underpinnings of the physical lay within the metaphysical and vice versa. What do I mean by this some may ask. Consider for a moment just who *we* are. You could distill it simply using the semetic lie of "just humans man, one race the human race" and of course ignore the myriad of lies within that statement. You could also go to the other extreme of "Hey guys were the owners of this world lets exterminate all, seig heil brothers, look how edgy I am" while ignoring the fact the person stating it is both circumcised as well as the fact their espousing Zionist rhetoric. We as a people are not as simplistic as these base bestial ideals espouse however. Once upon a time our peoples understanding of ourselves lay within the origin stories of a people be it the tale of Romulus and Remus or the God Kings who founded a nation and traced their lineage to Woden or one of the other ancient deities of our peoples. We were connected not merely by blood but by the collective history of our kin, by the shared history and intertwining of our peoples heroes as they fought for both higher ideals and the very dirt under their feet. It was by their Will that nations were forged, by their Will cities and monuments were created not merely for themselves but for our people, the very lifeblood of our nations poured into monuments truly worthy of our collective actions in order to help them understand what they can aspire to if they so wish it on not just a physical level but within ones spirit as well. What we must realise that if we ourselves are to emulate these Men, if we ourselves are to become more than mere victims in this modern semetic system is that we must ground ourselves within the fundamental understanding of our people. We are creators of the impossible, of wonders once thought mere dreams but we are not merely this for we are also Sons of higher ideals, Sons who serve not merely what lays within this realm but what lays beyond it. We are explorers, inventors, teachers, farmers, soldiers, Men forged from the clay of our lands in service to greater things. In service to our people, to what or who we consider greater be it a God or singular Men who fought for us or even towards the very spirit of our people. We must take what we need from these ideals and offer in turn ourselves to our people's future. So many get caught up within the "cult of personality" or singular objectives that they forget just what it is we fight for, just what is being demanded of us, their focus on only single talking heads or achieving singular goals with no greater planning. To expel the vile parasite is only a part of our battle, we must also excise the poisons it has inflicted upon us be it the hordes of foreign invaders that blight us or the self destructive ideals that have been forced unto us. Our duty is not merely to defeat our opposition but to also heal, both ourselves and our people, and both goals must be at the forefront of our actions as Men standing against the gloaming dark. It will do us little good to achieve victory with the removal of the parasite if by our side our kin lay wounded, blood seeping from their broken body as tears fill their eyes at the agony they suffered. We must balance ourselves. Love and hate, rage and tranquility, both must be forged in equal measure lest one overwhelm the other and we lose ourselves.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">It is no wonder one or the other finds prevelance in many of our kin though considering the situation. One of the hardest things in this age of misery is how isolating our situation is. Our forebears, those Men who stood and those men who merely followed for good or ill, for them it was a much simpler prospect. The enemy for them was clear. In a way it is clear for us also but by the same token it is not. Look at the Alternative Right and the modern "traditional" Christian movement. Both co opted beyond salvage, ravaged by the same disease that continues to haunt us even as we try to seek a direction to march towards. "Oh hey guys I run a podcast, send me bitcoin so I can make rudimentary predictions on what the Jews will always do, also feel free to join our forums and discord so we can datamine" or "Hey guys don't worry Christ has our backs, we'll win this so don't sweat it, also the earth is flat and giants are Old Testament truths, ignore the other semetic texts within it that countermand the New Testamant viewpoints". It is all the same old game by the same old players and yet here we sit watching as the disenfranchised populist supporters desperate in seeking a reason as to why events are happening as they are are in turn are funnelled into these pathetic simulacrums of resistance to the semetic powers. A sad truth is there is no political or spiritual path to victory at this time. There is us, only us. Can both the physical and spiritual be used as tools for our peoples survival to a degree, of course, what is a Man without faith in something above be it Christ, Woden or the heroes that came before, what is a Man without a clear vision of governance be it National Socialist or Fascist principals, he is but a small man of no import. But neither part can be allowed to take precedence over our people for both have inherit ideas that must compliment eachother when used in unison. A painful fact for Christians is that Christendom has failed, the texts that guided it proved fallible. Note I say Christendom, not Christ. Christ much like the older Gods of our people remains true and shall forever remain true. But Christendom has fallen to corruption by and large. The second harsh truth is that despite it's success National Socialism and Fascism have also both fallen. Despite it's effectiveness and ideals, much like Christianity it too has become subverted with the lunatic and the degenerate claiming it's symbols as their own be it in the "Neo Nazi" Jewish invented ethos or the tragically pathetic "Black Metal" scene who co opted it's symbolism for "edgy" visuals.<br><br>However when both Faith and the State are kept in check, kept within the bounds of ultimately serving our people, well they can make for true inspiration for they become tools for our people to create with. This is something the modern movements have entirely failed to understand. Modern Christians either pretend to be Traditional Catholics without batting an eye lid with their representitive wearing cat ears or the hilarious "Alt Right" religious wing is filled with zealots who consider such comically written books such as the Genesis 6 conspiracy to be legitimate or even the modern paganistic ideals with those who believe sitting in a forest chanting to trees to be "returning to tradition". Look at the costumed buffoon wearing a Swastika armband unironically while wandering the streets of Charlottesville or the British cretin who believes that wearing the Lightning Bolt upon his lapel at a National Action rally makes them "cool" rather than an imbecile, neither understanding the very underpinnings of National Socialism or British Fascism, this is the hallmark of this dark age. These beguiled fools, these desperate men cling to these ideals, cling to these symbols without ever truly understanding their purpose, their role or their importance for all they know is anger and resentment and they use these symbols in that way fanatically. Fanatics are needed in some forms yes but fanatics true to a cause, grounded within the truth of the symbol they raise high.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">What good is a Christian Zealot without the underpinning of his people and his nation to him? What good is a Fascist if all their grounded in is loyalty to the state and nothing such as a spiritual and a familial ideal? Unless both ideals are wielded in service to our people they are little other than a label, a pithy little marker created in an effort to say "look at me, i'm special", they are no different than the degenerative modern culture of "I am x, y or z" with the only difference being these symbols meaning something tangible compared to Jewish invented concepts, a fact these people do not truly understand. They know not the Swastika is not merely the symbol of National Socialist Germany but a European symbol millennia old, that National Socialism itself gained it's beauty as a system precisely because it served the people who held that same symbol and it's greater meaning within their hearts whether knowingly or unknowingly, that the British Lightning Bolt was not merely some "stylish" emblem but rather a symbol of change, of powerful change which was designed to serve the people rather than the corrupt disgusting amalgamation of political systems Britain had at that time. We must understand the meaning of these symbols and the Men who held them high for our people to see for without the understanding, without that truth, they become meaningless. The Swastika is boiled down to "fuck kikes", the Lightning Bolt is merely another way of saying "fuck parliamentary kikes", the Italian Fasc√© is just another way of saying "fuck migrants and kikes". These simple followers do not see the importance of these symbols, the message behind them nor even the beauty of them, not even at a fundamental level.<br><br>But there is something that transcends even these mighty symbols and noble ideals, something that echoes far beyond the troubles of this dire age. Who we are. The American. The Brit. The French, the German, the Italian, the Spaniard, the Polish, the Hungarian, the Romanian, the Swede, the Dutch, every last nation within our colonies and our homelands, they are all bound by one thing that can never be undone. One pivotal marker brings each of these peoples together with one vital and virtuous aspect. We are all European. We are all of one people, one beautiful and noble group. So I ask you, live in that sense that you are European. You are not beholden to the European Union nor colonial governments, you are not beholden to cowards within our occupied systems, you are beholden to your brother. To the kin at your side in this dire hour. To our people who suffer at the hands of our occupied governments, to our brothers in distant lands who suffer as we do, to our children, to our family and the greater family of our people. All must be lifted as one lest we all fall disunited and disgruntled to the hordes at our gates and the vipers in our beds. We are one people. We must sweep aside convention, we must sweep aside the failures of the past. Let us learn from our forefathers and hear their words, let us stand as they once did as Men, free Men who lift their brother from their knees, who shows a world that would see them destroyed that we ourselves will never surrender. That the spirit of our people is truly indomitable. Grant unto each other the succor to fight on, grant unto them the strength and the Will to carry on for no one else will. No one else will do our duty for us and it is indeed our duty to save ourselves. To bring our people hope. To bring them a vision of a future worthy of us. Live in that sense of being European, of history, of our peoples achievements and our glory. Break the shackles of lies and ursery, tear them from your torn and bloodied wrists. Sing the song of resistance so that we all have a tomorrow. Teach them the truths forgotten, show them the lies of this age of treachery, let the light of the European spirit dispel the shadows of the semite and it's puppet underlings.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Let us go forward, let those who dare follow us in this hour take from us what they need to ensure they too can fight on and lift those who come after us. Let us teach our kin the Swastika is truly ours and something beautiful and not the blood drenched lie the semite sells to the masses, let us show the gravitas of the Fasc√© to all who would listen, let us demonstrate the Lightning Bolt is not the realm of the skinhead but rather the vital energy for change. Let us restore the nobility and honour of our symbols, our ideals and our visions and let those who would stand against us fall to their own lies and semetic cowardice. Live in the sense of history and of destiny for it is yours. Yours is a history borne through bravery and through sacrifice, a history upon which the future must be built. A future worthy of our collective peoples. It has been done before and it can be done again. Through you. Through me. Through ourselves. Remember who you are, this I ask of you. Feel the blood in your veins, feel the soil beneath your feet. It is both yours and your peoples. No semite nor third worlder has claim to it nor can they for it is yours and yours alone. Let us understand ourselves and our people. Let us march to a better tomorrow so that our children and our kin may know a tomorrow free of fear and of sadness. What is needed is an act of Will, a collective action of like minded individuals who stand for something greater. It is the Will of Europe, the Will and the Will alone that is needed. So let us remember who we are. Let our banners rise high, let our heads lift as we gaze towards a horizon beyond the bloodshed and nightmares of this age. Together we must march towards a new tomorrow. Together we will make it through the darkening night.<br><br>Until victory be won.</div>

Unfortunately, this board does not have a wider influence past itself. Also, the many different ways those two ideals have been co-opted and corrupted are not true.

Atomwaffen, Strasserists, ReedSeej types or the fools who identify with "Generation Zyklon" when the fact is that pesticide was never used to gas jews. It's those who never studied NS in depth and believe the jew-fraudulently-made Germany and Hitler as a boogeyman theory instead, so they LARP along with the hate they think the movement is about. It's not about hate, in reality. <strong>National Socialism is about boundless love for your own people without permitting them to be infected by the most poisonous hate of all, that of the jew.</strong><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#84149">&gt;&gt;84149</a><br>"Fuck these kikes, fuck those kikes", both would work if not for the promotion of violence which only empowers the jew in government positions to wail for more enforcement and more laws to serve them as a protected class. Adding in heavy doses of jewish owned mainstream and social media, leading to constant brainwashing. Don't get me wrong. Not a single jew can be trusted, and not a drop of jewish blood should ever be permitted the freedom to continue their vile influences. It is too late for random acts of violence to curb the parasite. He has over 7 decades behind him of a fraud victim complex from an extremely frail tale of fiction about Germany. Of course this you already knew. I have the tendency to rehash that fact as much as possible. They have their holocaust "denial" laws for your nation and all across Europe. Hate speech laws too.

  <div class="divMessage">"Observe the herd which is grazing beside you. It does not know what yesterday or today is. It springs around, eats, rests, digests, jumps up again, and so from morning to night and from day to day, with its likes and dislikes closely tied to the peg of the moment, and thus neither melancholy nor weary. To witness this is hard for man, because he boasts to himself that his human race is better than the beast and yet looks with jealousy at its happiness. For he wishes only to live like the beast, neither weary nor amid pains, and he wants it in vain, because he does not will it as the animal does. One day the man demands of the beast: ‚ÄúWhy do you not talk to me about your happiness and only gaze at me?‚Äù The beast wants to answer, too, and say: ‚ÄúThat comes about because I always immediately forget what I wanted to say.‚Äù But by then the beast has already forgotten this reply and remains silent, so that the man wonders on once more." - Friedrich Nietzsche, <em>On the Use and Abuse of History for Life</em></div>

Your note on the role playing by these costumed fools is especially of import, I recall during what was termed a "pro white rally" one of the talking heads of the previous "alt right" wore a Stalhelm and rambled on about the "negro menace". I can't quite recall his name but apparently later much to everyone's supposed shock he suddenly renounced "Nazism" and became an SPLC lapdog. Yet people still cling to these talking heads like a puppy yearning to be petted by their owner. Lessons so rarely learned by the desperate.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#84180">&gt;&gt;84180</a><br>I appreciate your kind words, while our situation is bleak it is not without hope. Our enemy is cunning and our nations are being bled but while a single son of Europa draws breath then we are never beaten. They know this, it is why they fear and suppress us as they do. Their arrogance makes them weak. Our Will makes us strong.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#84250">&gt;&gt;84250</a><br>A true statement but one bereft of deeper understanding of the role of a true Overman. A simple man, a man who desires merely a quiet life will always submit unless prompted through dire circumstances and even then mayhaps a fifty fifty split as to whether he will act. It does not fall to them but to those with the Will to lead them and guide them to greener pastures. Allow me to offer an example. It is said something around twenty percent of the European population of America is sympathetic to "extreme right wing views". It is often touted around as a partial "white pill", a message that "Shit maybe we can rise up right now" by those who share that message. However that is 20% of 54% of the overall population and something rarely asked is of that 20% how many would act in their own interests? Mayhaps 3%, 5% at a push? Let us consider, there are no real Men leading most nationalist movements, most of the time it's talking heads or paid subversives so that small figure makes perfect sense. But indulge me once more with contemplating an additional factor; what if that twenty percent had a leader they could effectively believe in? A genuine Man, one that could not merely match but build upon the ideals, strength and charisma of say Rockwell? You merely need to offer the people something they desire, something that transcends the material offerings of this miserable age. Something that the Man who leads them not only understands but truly believes in.<br><br>In the time of Nietzsche he saw the fall of the Church from prominence, he saw the ever growing corruption of the state, it is little wonder he wrote as he did. His words "God is dead" was not a mockery but a lament, a desperate plea to try and reinstate greater ideals via the medium of personal greatness. He saw Men with strength as no longer being pivotal in this new age he found himself in for he saw the rot within his world and believed that those of singular strength must rise above it which I will grant is true. But his work, at least in my opinion, became marred by the corruption he witnessed within what at the time was one the fundamental pillars of his society and his own peoples tacit acceptance of it and thanks to these observations he forgot that Man can only become greater if he aspires to something beyond him. An Overman created purely around himself is a narcissist however an Overman created in pursuit and in duty to something greater than himself can grow indefinitely. He becomes not merely a leader but a beacon, an example of all that a Man can be and thusly simpler men have a path to follow, a path shown by that individual towards a collective goal. This was one of the fundamental principles of our peoples prior to semetic subversion, a true "Will to power" but not in service to the self but in service to the greater be it his nation or his spiritual deity or in almost all cases both. Heroes were not born from a single avenue but from a culmination of the people and their higher ideals. With the modern world stripped of both our peoples understanding of themselves and our spirit we have a barren world bereft of Men of worth. It is our duty to make the soil fertile again so that greater Men may be made anew.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Charting the course.<br><br>During this late hour many remain stagnant, waiting for that first spark of real resistance, that great leader to emerge who will grant us victory. While it is a comforting thought looking to such ideas is pointless for it is not our duty to wait nor follow but to forge a path and to create the environment where Men greater than ourselves can emerge from. I wish I could tell you such a path is easy. I wish I could tell you it will be bloodless, that it will be simple. That along the dark road ahead we will not lose brothers, that we will not lose some of those we love and fight for. I wish I could stand at your side and tell you all will be well and that all we need is a little patience. In an age such as this wishes of a better time, of a better future for our people, are as meaningless as the aether they drift upon. Our struggle is long, our foes vile and insidious. They would see us dead, our children servile and gelded at their feet while our women raped and degraded. They would break us upon the cold dead shores of a world they usurped as all falls to entropy. This we cannot allow. You know, it is an entertaining prospect isn't it. The only race that can truly stand against the vile and degenerative semite are the ones upon whom most of the known strains of humanity rely upon for civilisational advancement bar maybe the Japanese within Asia. The brown hordes are easy to enslave with promises of riches and blood, the negro is easy to prey upon with gluttony and hedonism while the Asiatic mixes are simple and compliant to those with a leash over them. To a simple mind such a statement would sound arrogant or supremecist but to those familiar with the world and it's people it is infact a far more disturbing prospect. Were we to fall, were we to be naught but a memory of lost greatness then humanity, innevitably, would fall. Oh, a period of stagnation would occur before that of course, a desperate bid to maintain the status quo as we are seeing now as more and more "vibrant diversity" is placed into key roles of our nations as they collapse. What we need is a path forward, one we ourselves must lay so our people may have a tomorrow.<br><br>Hah, to speak of tomorrow, it is a puzzling thing is it not. It all seems so hazy, so hard to gaze through the nightmares afflicting us now. But unless we do plan for tomorrow, unless we ourselves as Men, as sons of Europa and of her colonies prepare for the coming night then we shall not see it through to a new dawn. It is to us the future belongs, it is to us that others will look to when the looming shadows upon the horizon come closer into view. We must guide our people, protect them, fight for them. So many will be fearful, afraid of what tomorrow will bring. We, all of us, must grant them hope. We must temper it with truth, cold truths that may scare them but it is better to be truthful than to let them believe the comfortable lie. Do not instantly bombard them with the blood libels of the semite immediately, feed them slowly lest they choke on what you give them. You do not feed a starving man a banquet and thusly you do not feed a fearful man the full deluge of horrors of the past and present. With every truth show them a way forward, with every flinch of pain they suffer give them succor, for every tear shed grant them an embrace. Let them know they are not alone. That *we* are not alone. Forge them as you yourselves have been forged upon the crucible of this age of pain. Teach them the burden they bear they bear in place of their children, help them learn to stand as you have, turn them from pliable clay to Men with steeled spines and fill their spirits with the fires of hope and determination.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Show them a better way. Help them understand that as Men, as sons of Europa, that like all those before us they too will one day be but dust and echoes but before that time, before that last breath leaves our tired lips and our bodies surrender to time or pain, remind them that it is not our names that matter but our actions. That the collective actions of our people, our own individual actions as fathers and guardians of our kin and our peoples future is the most important duty we will ever have. They will not be remembered for amassing a sizable collection of action figures nor for being good at a sport. But they will be remembered by those they helped. By those they loved and protected. By those they fought for and in turn taught to fight, to resist. That, that my friends is true immortality and we must all remember that. To be remembered for deeds in service to a tangible ideal, an ideal in service to those we love. Those we protect. The semite would belittle such sacrifice, "So what goy, hes dead, you need to look out for number one as no one will remember him". Such shallow, sad little creatures. Those of truth, of dignity and of noble souls, their deeds live on even when names are forgotten or misremembered. It is the deeds that matter. Now it must be our deeds. This is the truth so many have forgotten. It is a truth we must all not merely remember but embrace.<br><br>You like I feel the despair upon the air, a miasma hangs over us akin to poisonous mist. It permeates like a sickening fog occluding all hopes and dreams of a future. You are right to be fearful, only a fool wouldn't be. But you like I must face it and forge through it. The rot approaches, the frost of a dire winter encroaches upon all our peoples lands. The semite is well aware of this for it was the harbinger of this misery and plots constantly towards our inevitable destruction. We must co ordinate, we must grant succor to each other and lift each other as we have never before. Those like I, sons of Albion who recognise the horrors put upon brothers by our vile "leaders" must atone for our collective sins against those we betrayed and fight like the Lion of old for both ourselves and all the brothers we have wronged. The sons of the American colony must cease their infighting and factional conflicts lest the hordes of negroes be set loose upon them before they realise what is happening. The sons of the Western heartlands of Europe must find common ground, must forget the conflicts of old lest the brown hordes subsume all in their wake while the semetic occupied system crushes them underfoot. The sons of Central and Eastern Europe must witness the burning embers of the Western nations and reinforce their bulwarks, prepare to face the coming dark as best they can. The children of the remaining colonies, both lost such as South Africa and remaining such as Australia and New Zealand and the remaining pockets in South America must steel themselves for their isolation means the battle may be all the harder. Above all, each and every one of us must stand as one against the coming night. As one we must raise our voices, as one we must let our hearts sing a song of resistance against the horrors before us, as one we must stand tall as we fight through the ashes of this dying civilisation. Fight for each other. Fight for your loved ones. Fight for your family, fight for your people. Fight for all that is noble and beautiful, defend it with every ounce of strength in your body and spirit. What we do in the coming years will echo throughout the ages. Will you cower, feel sorry for yourself and embittered yet impotent as all falls around you, not even a footnote upon the pages of history? Or will you stand, will you prepare and find purpose beyond what the semite offers you? I ask you to stand, stand for yourself and for your people. For the blood that runs in your veins, for those we have lost, for those we protect now and for those who will come after us. Stand with me. Stand with each other. Stand together. A better tomorrow awaits, we need only take hold of it.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">In the coming weeks I will be discussing potential avenues for preparation and planning for our own futures. Be it self sustainability, local√©s where a Man can either find or build a home in the homelands and the colonies, rudimentary advice for attempting to secure enough finance without playing semetic games and so forth. There is quite a bit of information to assess and I am no expert in these fields so it will take some time to ascertain viable or even reliable information.<br><br>Allow me to share one more thing I have learned from this time of misery and chaos. You and I, we are witness to the an ending. A crossroads where our choices as Men, as sons of Europa will have the greatest of consequences. The heroes who stood for us, the Men who stood against this tide so that we ourselves would not bear this burden, they have left this world. But their actions, their spirits have not left. We are pained in a myriad of ways, our bodies and spirits in a constant battle of attrition. We are wounded, we are afflicted by the horrors we witness, by the knowledge we bear. We will never be those Men who fought in decades and centuries past but we can be their avatar, we can embody all they held dear. We can be what they wished us to be. We can stand against all that comes and face it with spear in hand and our hearts alight with the fires of Hope and of Truth. It feels like we are the last, that we are few who stand against the tide. We are not. Our sons, our blood will carry on the fight when we fall as so many before us have. So let us make their job easier. Let us prepare what we can for them, let us grant unto them all we can so that when the hour tolls and our peoples stand as one they have both the tools and strength they need to see it done. So that the European peoples can rise once more from the ashes of this dying civilisation and become what we were and beyond even that. So that some of us can atone for our actions past, so that those we wronged embrace us as brothers once more. So that we are all free and our future is our own. We will rouse this Will of Europe and do what has to be done. For our families, for our blood, for our nations. When they look back on us, when they look at our actions and our efforts we must not be found wanting. Let us give them hope. When they see our faded photos, when they read our words or hear our message, when they glimpse at what we had created for them, let their hearts fill with awe and their spirits soar at what we did for them. Send to them a message that even when we are gone we are still with them. Let them know love, let them know peace, let them know joy and hope, let them dream of a future bright. Let us give them a chance at all we ourselves lost. Let them know that even in the darkest of hours hope lives and marches on. Let them know we fought for them.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">If it were possible, if we ourselves could take all the pain the parasite wishes to inflict upon our kin so that they may be free I have little doubt in the bravery and nobility of those like us who would step forward and embrace it, take the horrors unto themselves so that our people may be tormented no more. That even as the pain coursed through our body, even as we stifled the agonised cry in our chests we would lift our heads high and smile at the hated enemy knowing the sacrifice we made would be their end. That even at our weakest we are still sons of Europa and will never surrender to the most vile of enemies. That as we roared in defiance as our blood returned to the soil from which we were born from we gave all we could.<br><br>I am sorry I was gone for so long, even if I am but a stranger. I do not know if my words even reach anyone but should someone find succor in them then my duty proves worthwhile for what more can a Man ask for than knowing he made a difference if even in a small way. My name will never be known, likely yours will not be either. But together, together we can make a difference. Together we can save our future. So let us face the darkness of this age together for at our sides marches the ghosts of those who fought for us in ages past. To our people, to our soil, to our kin we must be true if we are to survive. Together we rise. Together we hold back the shadows. Together we will save all we hold dear. We have the tools to save our nations. We have ourselves, our history, our knowledge, we have our people. We merely must remember how to use them wisely. You are far greater than the semite would have you believe. So rise, off of your knees. Stand against the eternal night for there is no better hour than this. Let us be true to eachother. Let us have a vision of a future we deserve, a future that is ours and ours alone. In the name of our fathers. In the name of our people, in the name of our lands, in the name of Europa itself, in the name of all we hold dear let us stand as one.<br><br>Until victory be won. Until our people are free once more.</div>

And since I'm naturally anxious, I HAVE to be trained to deal with anxiety blindfolded with my hands tied behind my back, and fapping got in the way of that. So in my personnal case, it's a poison. I only noticed how much I was hooked when I actually tried to stop, I failed 2 or 3 times before making it past 2 months. Now I hoard the days I spent without fapping like a treasure, and I now it could be stoled by my own weakness in a matter of minutes. Fuck that.<br><br><br>If it's not an issue for you, you can keep fapping AS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION TO FINDING A WIFE, but yeah quit porn ASAP. This crap rots your brain and heart.</div>

I fear my emotion may of invaded the writing heavily and that it's influence may be evident throughout. None the less I offer it in it's raw form, consider it a draft perhaps. I hope it at least serves it's purpose to guide as was it's intended goal.<br><br>Unfortunately it is not the preparation and future planning for ourselves and our families topic that was promised. After several drafts and a number of notable issues by the end of it it was little more than a checklist of potential do's and don't and not a particularly good one at that. It is likely others wiser than I in the topic would offer far superior advice thusly it has been sidelined.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">To face the darkness within us. To be a man adrift in the ocean of despair in the modern world is to lost upon the tides of untold misery. What often ails us is not always from without but rather from within as well. Every soul born into this epoch, regardless of any conscious decision, has supped on the poisons offered by the semite and their "taste makers" or forced into situations they should never of been in. It is a time of abundance of the worst facets imaginable, ever degenerating pornography, over reliance of drugs, escape via the means of entertainment, indulging in hedonistic gluttony of both the food and carnal variety, the vast array of proffered goods is staggering. The merchant smiles at you as it hands you them, asking merely a pittance for some or not a single coin for others, more than willing to grant unto us his "bounty", his "generosity" seemingly magnanimous for it sells death in a multitude of forms. What I speak of now is not just for those men who fight to overcome these degenerative "gifts" and sometimes fail and thusly falling into deeper despair but also those that have dispelled their own illusions within the grand scheme of their lives and feel overwhelmed with the reality facing us and struggle to find the Will to fight and finally it is for those who through personal failings or by grim happenstance of fate suffer a life most dire. I speak of depression and it's cousin shame in this time of turmoil.<br><br>These dark emotions, these howling cries within us, the weight of them pressing down on our souls is almost indescribable. It often manifests not as a sadness per se but as a deep malaise that makes the world hollow and fill us to the brim with grey shiftless thought as we struggle to function in this vile world. Then, in a private moment when he believes himself alone a man may break down and weep, his torment breaking him for a brief instant as he falls to his knees unable to contain it any longer. He will cry out and no one will hear, the depths of his pain, his shame, his suffering and sorrow pulling him deeper into shadow. Moments later, when the maelstrom of stifling emotion has passed he will wipe his tears, lift himself back to his feet with what little strength remains, adjust his collar and make himself presentable and continue on as if nothing had happened. Oh, the act of normality may be convincing to himself and the world beyond yet deep within him the pain coils around his soul like a serpent, constricting the life from him as he operates to his best abilities in an attempt to disguise it, the misery burrowing deeper into him the longer he tries to ignore it. Such feelings, such raw pain and misery leads a Man to not merely have dark thoughts but to actively wish to die as he spirals ever further. It is a dark feeling, a feeling everyone at one point or another shall feel. Something will stay his hand for a time, some glimmer deep within him that holds against the darkness and tries to lighten his soul but the truth is such a gentle light can not last forever against the unfathomable depths of the human soul for that soul is drowning, drowning in the poison that fill it. When it comes to these feelings, these self destructive urges that rise from the misery, they exist for a reason. Something *does* need to die but not the one suffering but the part of him that inflicts that horrifying feeling. There is a dark irony in those souls who suffer such feelings in that they often recognise the problem yet the issue may seem insurmountable for they see themselves as weak. Whether it seem small or grand in scale, these dark thoughts stem from that sense of failure or lack of control over a particular aspect of our lives. All the mind knows is shadow and no true tomorrow, only the misery and despair of the now.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Whether it be the alcoholic angry at his own weakness while staring at the empty bottle in his hand and wishing he had kept his promise five bottles ago that it was to be his last, whether it be the weary pornography addict who sits ashamed of himself alone in his room disgusted at what he just found himself watching with shame heavy in his heart, whether it be the Man who looks out from his bedroom window over a city he once called home now lost to ethnic violence and degeneration finding no avenue of hope or even the obese man who stares at himself in the mirror filled with loathing at the creature before him and it's corpulent form, there is a dark part within every one of them that speaks the same litanies of hatred. "You will never put the bottle down, just finish it, drown yourself in it and end it". "You sick fuck jerking off to that shit, you know it's disgusting but you still do it, the fuck is wrong with you, no wonder you'll die alone". "There is no escape, where ever I go they'll just find me there eventually, maybe I should just end it". "You fat disgusting piece of shit, you'll amount to nothing, just eat you pig". These voices sadly speak a twisted truth, a truth flooded with venom. We recognise those issues, we see them laid bare and the darker part of ourselves, the part that we need to kill adds it's taunt and demands you surrender to it. Where once upon a time Men would have to actively over indulge in these weaknesses or have a particularly bad lot in life now it is handed out freely by our hated foe and thusly the degeneration of our people continues at a pace one can barely fathom. Our spirits have grown heavy with burden from them.<br><br>Yes, it is true the semite is the one who proffered the poison but the first step to defeating such things is acceptance. Acceptance of our weakness, we must recognise it for what it is, a diseased part we must excise in order to save ourselves. There is a reason the darkness is so overwhelming, why the level of hatred for ourselves and our failings is so great, it is because despite often knowing the solution we shrink away from it, fear and doubt heavy in our hearts. Often, when we are overwhelmed by these shadows, seeing a path beyond them seems hopeless, impossible, you are too weak the dark voice inside us says, you fell in the first place so how can you defeat it? The world is against you, how can you possibly hope to change your fate? In my posts previously I have focused on lifting the spirit, showing you the strength you are capable of and the values you fight for but for this we must return to the fundamental. You. You yourself. Indulge me if you would, imagine your ideal self. Do not go too far, make it a humble visage, one within the realm of potential reality. Ground it within the ideals and grant unto it the strength you wish you had at that moment. Now, with this mental construct grant unto it your voice, hear the words a nobler, better you may utter to one it cared for. Imagine the voice, hear it, hear it speak of what you can be. Do not aggrandise or imagine some overman, imagine simply a good Man. That, that is the true you. The you that you actually are, not the weakened state you are when held down within the darkness. Now make that construct command you. I do not mean ask, I do not mean politely say, I mean command you to fight the part of your troubles or your life that is destroying you. Let the strength the visage commands lift you whether it be in pursuit of something simple such as finding a path through a hard world or something as grand as finding the courage to continue your efforts for your family or your people, let that ideal you be the path forward. Do not make the construct a simple base thing obsessed with materialism or vanity but make it in service to your greater ideals, grant it true nobility so that you yourself can pursue it, so that you can find your true duty in this life whether it be in service to our people, our nations or our spiritual welfare.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Consider, how can a Man rise to something beyond the depraved and the corrupted if he cannot even know which way is upwards, how can he walk a path out of the shadows if he does not have a light to follow? A comforting hug, a few kind words, they can only achieve so much, a Man must have an understanding of what darkens him. He must understand he is more than that corrupting weakness no matter how overwhelming his troubles may seem. The European soul is a strong soul you see but also a gentle one, it can awaken the white hot fury within the hearts of Men pushing them to face challenges no other peoples could scarcely comprehend yet by the same token his heart can sing a song of love and kindness towards the kin he cares so greatly for. Why else would the semite seek to corrupt it so heavily were it not true, why else would they offer their wares so freely for all to consume, why else would they darken the world as they have. It has made us forget the strength we have within ourselves, made us weak and malleable to it's sweaty pathetic grip. It wishes to twist us, belittle us, turn us into the most base creatures imaginable and we see this in ourselves when we submit to it and drink deep of what they offer, we see the poison coursing through our veins and lament what we have become in accepting it. This is why a vision of the true you is needed. To know the Man you are, the Man you are capable of being. So take his strength, let the mental construct of who you truly are lift you. You are him and he is you. Whether you be a Man exemplifying the nobility and greatness of National Socialist, Fascist or classical pre semetic European values, whether you be a son of Christ or Woden who wishes to show the world your spirit does not yield and you fight on in service to higher ideals, whether you simply be a Man wishing to protect his family or his people, that true you is who you must be. All of us in some form or another will walk this crucible, it is down to the true you to guide you forward.<br><br>Do not misunderstand me though, such battles against the darkest parts of ourselves, they are some of the most grueling any soul can overcome. It is not an easy path nor a simple one, it is rife with moments of weakness, of misery and of sadness. Above all though it can be lonely. Your strength will be tested again and again, you may even fall again before truly lifting yourself up once more. Life is a long, winding path filled with moments of misery, loneliness and pain. But it is also far more than that. It is filled with moments of light, with love, with joy and with happiness. Yes, such ideas can seem distant, closer to a mirage on the horizon that a tangible future but that is the misery inside you trying to find purchase and drag you further down into the depths. What you walk is a path that every soul must walk at some time or another. The darkness of this moment within you will lift, of that you have my word but it must all start with you. Lift yourself you shall though, even if it seems impossible, even if you simply want to fall to your knees you must focus on the idea of who you truly are, not the you veiled in that moment of darkness.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">You shall rise. Your spirit, your blood demands it. It demands you stand once more. It demands you endure. Listen to it speak to you, listen to the voice within your soul ordering you to fight, to face down and destroy the misery within you, hear it even if the words are but whispers in the roaring cacophony of pain. You shall lift yourself as not just that voice asks you to but I do also. I am unknown to you and you to me yet here I sit, telling you, roaring at you to stand, a stranger bound to me by a shared brotherhood. Everyone sharing this burden with you is asking you to rise for they too understand more than you could ever know for the pain you feel they have felt too. You are not alone against this darkness. You are not abandoned. Every soul who reads these words and empathises, every son of Europa who understands your weakness is at your side lifting with you, everyone you have lost, everyone who has yet to grace your life with their presense is with you. So stand damn you, stand. Face down the misery for all who would call you brother will lend you their strength. All who would one day call you father or already do, all who would call you friend be they by your side or not, all who have suffered that same feeling of grey dread within them now is with you. Take their strength, take their belief in you becoming something more and let it lift you, let it make the vision of the true you become a reality so that you one day can return it tenfold when another finds themselves suffering. No one is coming to save us, we must save ourselves. Ourselves. Remember that, it starts with you so you in turn can save others from the darkness. There is no cavalry coming to relieve us just beyond the horizon for we are that cavalry, Christ cannot save us in the physical realm for he has already made the greatest of sacrifices for us before and now his sons must fight in his name until His return, Woden and the European Gods cannot save us for they already bestow upon their children the gifts they need to fight, there is only us, only eachother. So forge your path so that one day the misery of this age that afflicts us so can be a forgotten memory. So that the pain we suffer ends with us.<br><br>I know it's not easy. But nothing truly worthwhile ever is. Our private troubles, they may seem trivial to some, simple even, yet as humans, as people, they are often far more complex than we can ever articulate to others. Only kin can ever truly understand kin, only those whose soul shares the same template, those who have a shared blood can ever begin to comprehend their own peoples feelings and of them few are those who can truly stare into the depths of a Man's soul, fewer still who can understand what they see there. It is a hard thing to try and endure but endure you shall for you are not alone. Your misery, your self hatred, it can be defeated. So do so. For yourself, for yours brothers, for the higher powers you answer to, for a brighter tomorrow you shall succeed.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Until victory be won. Until this age of horror ends. We walk towards tomorrow side by side, our joys and sadness's shared as one. Our people, where ever they may be, as one. Your sorrows, your shames, your sadness, they are ours too and no longer will we abandon eachother to suffer them alone. No longer can we turn a blind eye or turn to mockery when one of our kin suffers. Once upon a time such thinking was a fundamental tenant of our individual nations and aimed mostly inwards with tenuous bonds of friendship for other brother nations beyond them. Now, in this dire hour it must grow beyond that, beyond simple borders to all kin who share our fate, who wish to stand against the rising tide. We must build upon the nationalistic ideals of old and expand it to all our people, all our kin who share our blood, our spirit and our heritage. We are Europeans one and all be us in the homelands or the colonies. Centuries may pass yet our blood remains the same, our spirits even when cowed and assaulted remain the same. Our woes are the same. Remember that. Remember we are one and that even in the darkest of nights, even when our spirits feel broken and we fall that there are still those out there who would lift you up, who would share words akin with what I have shared with you here, who fight on *for* you and have struggled like you. Who struggle still. Find that ideal self. Find the path forward. Tell yourself to march even when your feet feel heavy and your back aches. Push yourself onwards even when you believe you can go no further. Take your strength from where ever you may find it and rise, stand with your head tall once more and walk the path ahead. Your brothers are with you. Your people are with you. They need you. So come, walk with them. Let us face this time of woe together as one.</div>

I don't remember if I asked if you practice oration, though I'm sure you'd be subjected to harassment by both the parasites and police forces, just as anywhere else. The primary goals to keep in mind would be never to accept the Zionist offer and should you begin and lead an organization, <em>absolutely do not let in anyone with even a drop of jewish blood in their family history</em>. The majority of these modern orators are approached and swayed to their side both through threats and bribes. In the case of David Irving, he was both imprisoned and his family was threatened. My talent is more precise towards the removal of suspicious parties than that of eloquence. Should you decide to both stand up as a public speaker and deliver these exact messages, I would endeavor to join your group across the pond if only as the lesser role of making sure your organization does not fall to the parasite. As I'm sure you know, when groups spokesmen begin saying "not all jews", promoting any small lie about the holocaust fraud, regurgitating Zionist propaganda or insulting Hitler; that's a sure sign they're compromised already. The leeches always try to worm their way inside but their methods are obvious and methods which reveal them every single time equally so. What Hitler had during his speeches was a modicum of security. That is what you would need.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">As of late summer I was relieved of my position with my former employer. After crossing multiple lines, initially my refusal alongside a number of others concerning taking the vaccine with our argument consisting of our operating from home meant we had no outside interaction followed by a refusal to engage in a number of supposedly optional online "workshops" concerning "diversity" and "inclusion" I and a number of others was apparently flagged and investigated and found to be a "poor fit" for my position. I was one many dismissed alongside various other predominantly White individuals who had also chosen to not to engage in this farce. This unfortunately has had a rather dismal effect and due to my field being diversified I have spent quite some time merely trying to find a new position which sadly I have not. The knock on effect of this was a halting to any and all work such as my effort on this thread as well as other personal projects. Despite this and the instability it has caused however I am now attempting to return to these efforts for a great many more than myself have suffered far worse under current conditions and the "luxury" of self pity is one that is hugely detrimental, especially with the way things stand for us all now. <br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#84802">&gt;&gt;84802</a><br>I have no real official training in oration beyond a minor corporate role I held quite a few years ago. As for a concerted movement were I in central Europe or America I would gladly make efforts to make an attempt at public speaking but the soil here is too poisoned for anything real to grow, at least in the open. After National Action our government used it's window from that state led operation to ensure any and all resistance essentially is smothered in the crib as it were with a slew of legislation that even went so far as making a weak critique of zionism to be worthy of investigation while their ability to simply manufacture charges is unchallenged at this point. Even what passes as "resistance" here such as Patriotic Alternative have devolved into a slightly edgy UKIP, tongues so lashed they nary speak a word beyond subtle phrasing against the parasite. On occasion I do let my mind wander to the idea of just packing up and trying to escape this island to a place I could actually prove effective but two things always stop me. The first is simply where to go, my heart says to America where things are escalating the most or one of the nations on the southern portion of Europe facing the golems hordes of "climate refugees" such as Italy, Spain or Greece but the logistics as well as my duty to my family make such an idea difficult, especially with immigration policies. This is even before considering how to begin any such project and the potential language and cultural barriers. The second is if I do abandon this blighted isle then I would be no better than the cowards who flee to some predominantly white far flung city abroad and deign to speak of our situation more openly yet only being brave enough to do so after leaving, daring to collect coin for their "troubles" like the charlatans they are, an accusation that would not be unfairly placed were I to try such a thing.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Upon the importance of sincerity and the need for leaders. <br><br>A time of misery, a time of lies. Here we exist you and I, forgotten souls wishing to save not merely ourselves but the kindred souls of our people now fallen into shadow. Even our lightest step illicits a racing heart at the threat of the semite and it's hounds hearing our march. We know our duty. We know for what and for whom we fight. This is a burden not taken lightly nor does it come easy but it is a burden we bear for our hearts and souls burn bright through the grey malaise of this modern world, we choose to bear this weight for we are not afraid to face this darkness around us. We are sincere in our cause, in our hopes and dreams. We have no need to dress them in borrowed rhetoric nor left or right window dressing for it transcends such petty boundaries, bound not to noble nor commoner nor Christian nor Pagan or any other dividing factor, our position is to be beholden only to our people. But for those with weaker hearts who yet understand the lies of this age it is not a simple proposition. They hide their feelings within irony, twist the truth to be more palatable in the hopes that their use of "optics" will spare them the semites twisted poisoned claws. It is always an interesting sight to behold, watching the devolution as these talking heads gain traction, the slow shift from advocating for our people to then injecting rhetoric with subtle mainstream messages adjusted just enough to be "edgy".<br><br>One must ask whom is left with a stout enough heart to speak truth undiluted within the public sphere, whom operates without an agenda. A sad fact is none do for their sincerity is always for sale. You may think I am generalising but let me ask you a simple question; in a system utterly controlled by a paranoid and often schizophrenic foe how does one exist? Among the cracks is how. Here. Pockets of anonymous boards and forums. Among small groups whom dare not peek above the parapet. Oh, our foe will continue to drive us off, infiltrating and closing each bolthole, tracing any relevant information it can and we will move among the masses until finding a new holdout from which to share the truth of this dire world and the need for change. We are dissidents, insurgents, veritable demons to the semites "perfect" world of despair and chaos. We are the heretic whispering in the ear of it's foul servants, we are the monsters who would topple their Tower of Babel built upon the corpses of our people, we are the Sons of the West, the Sons of Christ, the Sons of Woden, the Sons of a people whom dreamed and achieved the impossible. Kindred souls who in the darkest of hours lift our heads in defiance of their will. That is the sincere truth of our duty and that is why they will never allow us to speak in the open. But the insincere, the coward pretending to be brave, oh he will be allowed for they are easy to corrupt, easy to sway. Their conviction is lacking and thusly the chinks in their armour are revealed on the outset. Fuentes and his fall to simply being another neoconservative after being essentially outed as a homosexual to all but the most blinded. E Micheal Jones and his now constant refusal to consider our race as a collective, choosing to view us simply as "ethnicities". Viktor Orb√°n and his words edging on "anti semitism" and resisting immigrant invasion while filling his cabinet with parasites. Donald Trump and his supposed reading of My Struggle and relatively positive rhetoric yet whoring his children off to semetic filth and serving as the self proclaimed "King of Israel" while sundering America's already weakened border. It does not matter how small nor how big the movement and the individual is, if they in any way operate within a public platform then you can guarantee there is no sincerity to them.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">There is no "our guy" among any of them as it is so colliquely termed. There is no real Will nor resistance for those within this sphere are utilising a framework that is antithetical to their very existence were they to be sincere. They serve but one goal; to lead any who would resist back into subservience to a system that would see them dead. I do believe some of those who have emerged within the last few decades may of emerged organically alongside the manufactured counterparts but by the end both the organic and manufactured groups are essentially the same with only minor differences, all still existing to serve the existing power structure regardless if that was the design from the outset. You cannot subvert the subverter. You can only face it openly, this is the rule so many seem to miss within modern movements.<br><br>A while ago I shared a dream with you. A dream of a world where our people no longer live in fear, no longer exist in what is essentially open air prison camps with the semites imported golems serving as guards and the disgusting creatures themselves as degenerate judges and administrators of us and their pets. A dream where our lands, the homelands and the colonies, live not merely in peace but as grand bastions of our peoples. So long have we been downtrodden that we have forgotten the wonders we forged, the beauty we can create when free of weak greedy leaders and corrupted uncontrolled capitalism. Where the state and the people act as one in each others interests, where our children's futures are safe and secure. I do not care what happens to those not of our ilk for their fate is their own, it is not our peoples duty to guide nor engage them. I wish them no harm but among us they are not welcome and should they threaten us then they would be dealt with as fitting for the aggression. All I wish is for peace in our children's time and a future we choose ourselves. This dream is not the dream of a great Man. It is not even a dream that is unique for Men in ages past have had this ideal. It is a dream I, a faceless brother on a distant shore, wish for us all to share. A dream of something better. So I ask, why is those who seek power, who place themselves as "leaders" never share such a thing? Why is it the talking heads will at first openly talk about jewish power, will openly invoke truths known to those like us yet never offer a vision of a better tomorrow? I say this to you, the "groyper", to you the "proud boy", to you the follower of talking heads, why do they never offer you a tomorrow? Is it because they do not know a path there? Or is it to ensnare your interest to then lead you down a path of hollow resistance. I myself do not know the full path towards this dream, at least not directly. But I feel it in my blood. I feel it in my soul, in my spirit that this dream will be made manifest. The path to it will be bloody, it will be terrifying as the semites claws dig further and further into the flesh of our nations. It will come at a cost none of us can foresee. But that tomorrow, that dream will be made true but only if each of us are sincere in that goal, in our duty to our people. No hiding it behind cynicism or comedy, we must accept it whole for what it is; the preservation and the propagation of our people. Anything less will lead to nothing at all, a life lived poorly in service to nothing beyond the mundane. All they offer is but a path to stagnation and oblivion. Any Man of worth would offer a future worth fighting for, worth dying for.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Another thing lacking in leaders of modern movements is the ability to accept criticism. A leader must be judged harshly by both himself and his followers. He must recognise his weaknesses and compensate for them with those who would keep him on the path towards his goal. He must realise he fights not for himself but for those at his side, for those who look to him for hope, who would rise to stand by his side on this day and in days to come. He must be sincere in all he says and all he does lest he become as treacherous as the foe he faces. But there is something else just as important for a leader to have beyond self reflection, mayhaps more important; empathy. He must feel the pain of his people, feel their joys, their hopes, their dreams for they are his too. Consider how the greatest of our leaders have usually been Men born from conflict. Watching brothers fall to their knees weeping in despair as the horrors of war overtake them, wiping the blood from a brothers brow as he inhales his last breath, deep wounds stealing him from a world of pain. It is from these noble souls emerged an empathy, a drive not merely to cease this bloodshed but to make it so these moments of horror would no longer continue to happen for reasons of international politicking or greed. Now though, now the pain is not simply within foreign battlefields or distant conflicts. Now a new pain is all around us. <br><br>It is within the eyes of a soul lost to drugs and alcohol in a world he cannot find his place in. It is in the voice of the elderly grandmother who asks her son or daughter why her grandchild has killed themselves in a bout of depression from realising their future is gone. It is within the White woman who foolishly trusted the semites lies and believed blacks were not violent nor depraved and found herself bloodied and broken or the violated child who was kidnapped and gangraped by third world filth, unaware of her "sin" of being White within her own native lands. The horror is here, it surrounds us, it poisons our very being. So why, why I ask will no one stand up for them, why will no one of these wretched pitiful "leaders" fight for them? Why? The pain of this age is evident, like you I feel it every time I glimpse at a newspaper or television, I witness it when visiting my city of birth so why do they cower when they speak, why do modern "leaders" subtly sidestep these atrocities that are happening in all our lands? Why do they avoid even saying "White" in at very best neutral terms, why are their voices devoid of love or fire. It is true we become numb to these atrocities but those who would fight or ask others to heed their words cannot allow themselves the luxury of this distancing. They cannot for to do so would be to numb the part of their soul that not only feels rage and hatred but love and peace. They would become automatons spouting worthless phrases akin to the mainstream "politically engaged", shells acting on simple instruction. To become numb is simply to not care. We cannot allow ourselves to become like that lest the parasite truly has won. To speak without fury is to be unable to speak with love. To talk about atrocities without a hint of emotion is to condone them whole heartedly. It is to have the soul die cold and blackened by a world so vile. Only the most twisted and debased can react in such a fashion.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">All of us, myself included, seek a leader to rally to. A banner to raise on their behalf so that we may be guided, so that we can lift our voices to theirs. So that we can find a brother to whom we can place our faith in. When I seek faith in our people, when I seek hope, I look to two places. I look to the texts of those who stood before in the hopes of understanding Men greater than I, their dreams and inspirations. Then I look to you. You who share in this struggle. Whom despite this dark hour stand tall, who even at our worst are still Men who would dare to resist, who have suffered the same torments yet still stand. Those who are defiant. I look to you because you are brothers, even with the constant denigration by the semite, even with constant subversion and attacks you refuse to yield. I have stated before everything written here is not simply the work of myself but rather those who came before and those who fight on still. They are written both because of you and for you as they were given to me in one form or another by those just like you. We heal each others wounds, we guide where we can, we fight the battles we can fight in the hopes of a better tomorrow. We must look to each other if we are to survive, we must look to those who have the Will and the vision to forge ahead into darkening night. In an age where social media and the cult of personality are so rampant it is to those who speak truth unfettered that our eyes must turn, to ourselves. The charlatan would ask for your coin. The liar would ask for your trust. Any who resist must ask but one thing from their brothers in this dark hour; that they stand for their people. Nothing more, nothing less. So I ask you, those who read these words, I ask you to rally, to rally for ourselves, for each other, to rise off your knees from the dirt and muck the semite would have us scrabble in.<br><br>Any Man worth hearing will ask we stand as one, that we find what path we can forward towards our goals in whichever form we choose be it simply enlightening one you trust to our plight or forming a group of local friends to share a drink and make preparations for a future that is grim or even simply doing what you can to lift the souls of brothers lost to the misery of this age. It takes bravery to walk this path. It takes strength, courage and nobility. It takes sincerity. Every step we take echoes in our wake, every footfall through the ashes of this age is a marker for those who would follow behind us, who would stand with us as the hour grows late. It is no one leaders banner we raise. It is the banner of our people in whatever form we choose to give it that we raise. It will burn brightly, the banner you raise, scouring the darkness around you leading kindred souls to you. It is those brothers at your side, those who would share your faith that your faith in turn must be placed within as well. Only then can we be sure we will not lose our way. We are Men against time. Men against a world twisted and deformed from what it should be. Men tested to their limits by the wounds we bare and the nightmares encroaching on us. But we are Europeans, we are blood, no matter the centuries separated by colonisation, no matter the distances we travel. We are brothers. We are not alone. You are not alone. It is not talking heads or political leaders we must turn to now but each other, to ourselves. So that should we tire of all this pain they may shield us so that we may get back upon our feet. So that we in turn can protect those who need protecting, so that our women and children need no longer live in fear, so that our families and our blood have a future free from the semites clutches.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">We will deliver them the future they deserve, that was stolen from us. It will not be the talking heads nor the "intellectuals", it will not be politicians nor a self proclaimed leader but us, Men like ourselves. We only need the bravery and the Will to stand. You, all of you have found your path here, to where we stand at the crossroads with the shadow of entropy and death looming over our lands and peoples. *You* are the future, you are the hope. Your children, your family, those who would look to you for guidance, they are the future. No more factions, no more false leaders, no more arguments over petty political abstractions of left versus right, there is simply those who would fight and those who would cower away and wait for death. We have seen the decrepit tree of liberalism and conservatism and the warped twisted fruit it has bore. We have seen the schisms in our faiths, the blood letting between sects of Christianity, Paganism and countless other religious abstractions. We are no longer merely left or right, Christian or Pagan. We are one. One race. One people with one hope, one goal. One dream for which we must stand side by side against the dark tomorrow we face. A future for our people. Be it a form of National Socialism fitting a nations character, be it under a racially aware form of fascism, it matters not, what matters now is we ensure our people can have that, that they have a future in which they can even have a chance to build something worthy of themselves, that the current semetic system of division is torn up by it's roots and the canker of Jewish power is removed completely and the golems it forced upon us are removed alongside them. <br><br>We are the arbiters of our own fate. We must choose, unification of purpose or oblivion through semetic entropy. I know what I choose. I choose you. I choose my brothers. I choose our people. I choose hope, I choose a future which we ourselves forge. Too much blood has been spilled, too many sacrifices have been made for me not to choose such a thing. Too many good men lost to the fires of semetic influenced wars and the choices of weak men. No more. No more suffering, no more pain and uncertainty. We must, together, see this nightmare to an end. Only then, upon the ruins of this age, can we build anew. Only then can our people find purpose once more. So fight. Your people need you. I need you, your brothers need you. You and I may not have a leader but we do not need a single figure to rally to, we know our duty. We know our fight, we have known all along.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Some deride the fourteen words as an archaic and silly thing. I do not. I see it as the foundations upon which we fight, a vow even if used flippantly by those who do not understand it's importance. It is a goal, a duty we must see through if we are to survive. It is a vow any Christian, Pagan, National Socialist, Fascist or any other offshoot must adhere to if they are genuine in their hopes for a better tomorrow. So stand Sons of Europa, stand once more as your forefathers did. Stand as your brothers do against this age of misery. Stand for the betrayed, for the weak, for those who cannot defend themselves. For those that you love. Stand against the darkness that encroaches. The enemy show us their vision of our future, a future in which we are subsumed in a black and brown tide, ourselves bled and brutalised til' we beg for death. Those who pretend to lead offer us their vision under false hopes and comfortable lies, their facade of peaceful segregation and "only letting the right ones in" proven a lie from decades of experience. Our vision is not be led by one man, not built within the framework of the semetic system we have. Our vision must be *of* our people, *of* our victory, of peace for our people and our lands. The path ahead shall be drenched within blood and within horror, the troubles of our time may pale at what is to come. But we shall face these nightmares as we have time and again, our hearts aflame with hope and the Will to face the enemy down. Every beginning has an end. Jewish power began centuries ago, the subversions and the horrors unleashed thus far uncountable. We are it's end. We are the end of this age of misery, our people have suffered enough, defy the parasites power. Defy their will. No matter what it takes, no matter how long it takes we will defy them and we shall walk free once more.<br><br>Until victory be won.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#85992">&gt;&gt;85992</a><br>You are describing almost exactly what I've went through here in the US of ZOG besides the fact my job requires person to person interaction. Don't believe if you're in America that you'd have an easier time of it. This is certainly the most degeneracy here. 'Freedom of speech' exists only until you offend jews or any of their braindead golems. They have Twitter cancel culture behind them, with ridiculous 'professional' organizations more than willing to end someone's career over tweets. Even more should protestors with multi-colored hair show up. There isn't a court in the US that would side for it's own people against the eternal victim parasites. About cowards who flee, I have attempted to gain numbers through freeing minds in person, with successes and failures, yet for the ones I've succeeded with - they've either engaged in 'white flight' or tuned into idiot boxes (television and wikipedia to rebrainwash and reassert stupidity) every single time. Hitler began with 9 and increased membership over 13 years. After many years, I still have just the 1. That is myself.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#85994">&gt;&gt;85994</a><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#85995">&gt;&gt;85995</a><br>Well explained. None are willing to face the threat directly because while the parasites are notorious for being weak, lazy and unwilling to work, they <strong>own</strong> those who enforce the laws. Sure, gazing at North America from the distance of media, these colonies may seem like they're freer. Certainly to a man with your accent, they would seem so at first steps. In any career, you would easily obtain promotion over those who have served as wage-slaves longer. That is unless you speak up against any of the parasites' subversive viewpoints that they hypocritically never apply to themselves but for others. Then you would be terminated from your new job. An Outcast. Fighting and dying for an ideal is one thing, but that very death is the problem. Hitler clearly died. Goebbels, Himmler, Reinhard, Eichmann, G√∂ring, Muller, Mengele etc. Every old guard National Socialist besides the extremely elderly these bullies try with false war crimes, are dead. Their memories are shat on as they're listed as "perpetrators of the holocaust". The greatest jewish fraud.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#85996">&gt;&gt;85996</a><br>Here you ask why no one will stand up for the gangraped, violated children, brainwashed European descended woman with jungle fever murdered or the despairing grandmother of her suicidal and deceased grandchild. Why they cower and have no passion. The answer is influence. Sure there have been those who have stood up and said "murder, rape and suicide is bad" and they are applauded for the sheer vagueness of it. Yet the ones who speak (true) specifics about who is responsible are swiftly shut down. These positions of leadership came at a price. They're bribed and or blackmailed, terrified of losing their positions or if not and they do speak up, they will lose them. It is like the King absurdly swearing loyalty to the court jew. As you said: shells acting on simple instruction.<br><span class="greenText">&gt;We cannot allow ourselves to become like that lest the parasite truly has won.</span><br>From everything I have seen alongside 40 years of living with their vile propaganda deep in every facet of society, the parasite has already won. As you said: We exist among the cracks. Anonymous boards, small groups not daring to peek out. Continuously driven away until we find new holdouts.<br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#85997">&gt;&gt;85997</a><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#85999">&gt;&gt;85999</a><br>Your message is why you should be the talking head. This and many sentiments you've made before. Our Guy may never magically show up. Not without being compromised. Hitler was one chance in billions and indeed he still made mistakes like permitting the "half jewish" (any percentage is tainted) Theodor Morell despite the NSDAP being aware. This led to health issues as Hitler was given harsh drugs for a false diagnosis. Believing as he was told, that his light would go out anytime, certainly contributed to Generals botching war plans during his failing health and then eventual suicide. Bad irony, since he initially lost both parents along with siblings Otto, Gustav, Edmund and Ida to jewish doctors like Eduard Bloch.</div>

They were given more rights and luxuries long after their ancestors were stolen by the jew with the word slave and negro and then after Judah Benjamin the jew's KKK intentional jewish race conflict. Now they're called black and 'wage worker', but for 14 year old Zoomer dipshits, that's "offensive" too. Yet if you say 'African American' it's "white and corny". They're portrayed in mainstream media as middle class uncle Toms so black people are coming across as much less 'gangsta' unless they're rapper posers or extreme lower class. They're middle America now, and by the jew, replacing European characters in media adaptations. This replacement is intentional and they're still enslaved to jewish organizations. Kikes only broadened their scope on who would be slaves and changed the words. We're all slaves now. It's called the 9 to 5. I'm all for blacks having Africa and European descendants emigrating back to Europe. I'm all for them taking Israel for the Black Hebrew movement. This video is why.

Unlike the kike shill believes, eventual failure while there was success 33 through 45, does not equal intentional failure. There was the best attempt. The jewish banks were tricked as they first financed, but where afterwards cast out to their surprise. Thus the greedy bastards, with the loss of Germany in their worldwide plans for domination, were determined to crush National Socialism not only until 1945 but over 70 years following. National Socialism is the only ideal jews fear. They have stated their lies about it for decades and use fake examples to tighten their grip, but still shit themselves about the notion of losing authority to it again. When it rose in Germany the first time, jews fled over the years. Kikes would flee faster next time. <span class="redText">That is why NS is the only way forward.</span></div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#86001">&gt;&gt;86001</a><br>If I may say you and those like you who have been in this far longer than I often do yourselves a disservice in your perception that your failing in helping your friends understand the state of things and getting them to stand against it means you yourself have failed in some manner. You are right that Hitler in the beer halls bought hope to his people, showed them what they could be. You need to realise you yourself have done this as well, mayhaps not in the same way but you genuinely have. As a critical mass of racial awareness has taken place on each larger chan or pocket of the internet, be it 4 or 8chan or any of the other previous uncensored places, it was you and people like you, the proponents of the true events of the vile wars and the ideals behind National Socialism, that led myself and countless others to not merely understanding the truth around the events that remained fogged in lies but showed such lies could be stood against. Without people like yourself and those who use these boards word would never of spread, the names of good Men would forever be marred and those seeking the truth of this age would forever be trapped in the nightmare of semetic lies. You, all those who frequent this board, who frequented each board and discussion thread prior to the hammer falling, showed people like myself there was more to the dire state of things than we had known. It was people like you that pushed people like me into the original /sig/ threads, who discussed the old German training manuals, who taught people like me about classical music and the creations of Wagner, the beauty of classical art, who helped hollow men understand what the true spirit within them is, you and all who have reside here and the prior places taught men like myself there was a chance at something better through knowledge and through action. <br><br>Concerning your comment on the depth of the propaganda within society you are indeed correct. However there does appear to be some cracks forming, at least to a minor degree. A friend of mine pointed me towards a youtube comment section of all things, thinking I'd be entertained. It was for some terrible animated Christmas movie with some screeching jewess, plot is something along the lines of "Santa is white and a man therefore hes bad, I'm a jewish woman pretending to be white, I should be santa". You can imagine the tropes of course in the trailer. What did made me choke on my coffee with a chuckle though was the array of comments. "The Toyim Know". "This is why you got kicked from 109 countries". On and on it went, it was rather entertaining. I've an addon to use youtube anonymously as well as show dislikes and much to my chagrin it was absolutely butchered. Yes, it was only a simple small victory and soon comments were locked shortly after but before that the entire section was aflame with jokes and people pointing out how the cast were all jewish. I do believe, at least to a degree, that an awareness is slowly creeping in, not quite as loud as one may hope but people thanks to the covid situation are mayhaps starting to wander into looking at things from sources they normally wouldn't. Oh, don't misunderstand, I highly doubt it's a sign of a sudden huge resurgence of racial awareness but I do think it might be the seeds of something germinating slowly. They do seem to be on the defensive an awful lot of late, they even began scrubbing early life sections on wikipedia the last year or so. Throw in the recent conflict in Palestine and their desperate attempts to spin their murderous rampage and certain oddball conspiracy circles noting the Ghislaine Maxwell's trial has an Israeli judge and her involvement in the sex trade in Israel of White Central and Eastern European women (and let us be honest, children) and how little reporting is being done to the public it does seem certain things are slipping through the cracks.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#86069">&gt;&gt;86069</a><br>An astute analysis, especially concerning the groypers. After the recent negro race attack where the killer rammed a Christmas parade composed of mostly of white families and murdering six in Wisconsin a large contingent of groypers on twitter were celebrating the act as "they would grow up to be coal burners". Murdered little White girls, coal burners. I do not know what den of homosexual degeneracy that vile little cretin Nick Fuentes is creating in his corner but it's certainly one of the more disgusting groups in my eyes now. <br><br>Also invoking Plato's cave is a very sharp way of putting it when it comes to a lack of Will, it really is the most accurate image of how things currently function. <br><br><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#86076">&gt;&gt;86076</a><br>Like yourself I do disagree with E Micheal Jones on his view on race but his understanding of biblical scripture is definitely excellent, he has a real passion when discussing it. His book Slaughter of Cities is pretty good as well, you need to read between the lines a bit as he avoids invoking race preferring to use Catholic as it's stand in but it fairly accurately charts how American cities became what they are today.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">So the article concerning internet security is coming along fairly well, i've removed a fair chunk of it concerning the technical details as such a thing is of little concern to most, i've instead opted to include links discussing issues for the more technically minded. While it won't be January it will be early February assuming there's no drastic change in the general landscape. Instead tonight is a short off the cuff piece, one I felt needed as we are indeed in a new year now and as with the depths of winter some souls need soothing or reminding for what our duty demands of us. Therefore I present the following, written while slightly inebriated I must admit but from the heart none the less. Let us hope the next time I come to the thread I do not shy away in embarrassment.<br><br>I would also like to sincerely thank whomever stickied this thread, I am humbled that such work is considered significant enough to be worth such a thing, especially considering the other threads concerning National Socialist policy and the dispelling of jewish dogma. I hope my efforts remain worth of such kindness.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">Rousing the will.<br><br>A new year. Another tick on the calendar as our nations rot and decay as the semite and it's servants enshroud our lands, the threat of eternal night growing ever closer. It is a dark time, a cold time. A time where one feels nought, the stagnant air awaiting the first movements of a system geared towards nought but desolation. Akin to the first thawing of winter in the coming weeks and months we shall witness the initial moves the zionist forces arrayed against us. What machinations will be placed before us one must ask, will it be "climate refugees" flooding our borders, will it be further veneration of the negro and the third worlder, will it be further false sins of our collected peoples actions? What horrors await we can only wonder. Rather than waiting for such horrors though, rather than merely being reactive, rather than watching the downfall of our civilisation, I would propose a new course, a new path in the darkness of this age. In this thread I have spoken of dreams, of ideals, of the values and traditions of the European peoples in the homelands and within the colonies. The same people, the same kind, we are one, our dreams and hopes the same, surpassing barriers of language and politics. I come to you to ask your ear, to ask your strength. Who am I to ask such a thing though, I am but a stranger, a stranger upon distant shores. Only I am not a stranger. Not to you. Nor are you a stranger to me nor are you to your brothers. For you are my family. My blood. Even if separated by centuries, by countless miles, you are still European. You are still my kin. <br><br>Many have dreamed of unification, whether through a spiritual unity via a faith or a political union via a grand body that represents each nation. That is not something we can achieve in this hour for the semite holds sway within both courts. Instead a unification of race is what must be asked. Our people are unequaled in the history of mankind, each of our peoples representing one of the greater and nobler facets of humanity. I do not shy from stating such a fact for it is truth, from the construction of incredible monuments to the words written by great Men past that elevated us beyond the mundane we have a right to exist, nay thrive. We do not seek dominion over others, we do not seek power, we merely seek our freedom in our nations to  be free. To live, to love, to place our energy, our valour and our heroism on the line to pursue greater things than the mundane and frankly semetic material goals. The jewish soul, the semetic filth that control our nations, would see us shackled to their whims, to see their material control only grow, to see the spirit of our people whither and die. I ask you to deny them that goal, to deny them that victory. I ask you to hear the voice of your people, to hear the voice of those who fought against this dire end. Of those who fell trying to ensure *you* may have a future. We drift, we do not live we merely survive, we do not see brother Europeans as true brothers but as either weaklings or competitors, in place of empathy is scorn, in place of love is loathing. No more.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">I am British. My people are loathed, the English people are loathed and rightly so, many nationalists beyond my borders witness our arrogance is unbound and other than Mosley and Bowden our leaders and speakers are serpents. This, despite the denials of my kin, is the cold truth. But the vile leaders of my nation and the puppets who served them are not who I hold in my heart. Those who heeded the words of greater Men share this feeling. We hold the true English, the truth British, the true Europeans who suffer in this time in our hearts. I care not where you hail from, I care not what history you hold for if you are true, if you are of noble spirit and character then you are my brother, then you embody the European spirit. I will fight for you. I will die for you. There is no nobler a cause than to fall protecting such a thing and if you believe such an ideal false then I ask you to look to Degrelle, to Hitler, to Mussolini, to Rockwell, to any who have dared to deny the semite control of better Men. No sane man would die for this current regime, no Man of right mind would fight for this decadent and disgusting age. But a Man would die for his people. He would die for his Nation. He would die for his brother. That, that is the dedication of a hero, unequaled in the history of mankind other than within the Japanese subgroup of humanity. <br><br>The thing is though, I am not asking you to die. I am not asking you to sacrifice. Nay, I ask you to live. To be bold, to heed my words, to build anew from the ruins of this age. To have a family, to have brothers at your side, to rise above the ashes of this misery. That is what I ask, all I ask. All your brothers ask, your families ask, your nations ask, your people ask. I ask you, I implore you, tell me what is it I can give you to stand in this hour. Ask it and if it is in my power I shall give it. Is it hope? Then take mine, take it and let it fuel your ascent from the dark depths of this age. Is it money? Then let me find a way for you to be financially stable, I do not care what it takes to do find a way for you. Is it friendship? Then let me find a way to safely allow us to communicate beyond a board, where we can merely share small talk and chat as brothers, if that is what you desire then you shall have it. I do not care the effort it takes, I do not care. All I care about is saving our people. All any of those worth anything is saving our kin. Too long have we drifted, too long have we simply sat, waiting for someone to show us the way forward. We *have* the way forward. To exemplify the virtues that make us great. To exalt our faith, our kin, our homelands. To protect them, to ensure they do not merely exist but they propagate even in the darkest of times. I am not content with merely existing. I am not content with merely watching. I would gamble nor are you. So let us fight. Let us stand. Let us, as brothers, march forward. Let us embody the facets that make us who we are. Let us show those who have surrendered that they are not truly lost, that they need not live on their knees. That hope, that the dream of a better tomorrow has not abandoned us. That we are no servile puppets of a semetic system. That we, we few who resist, are the inheritors of tomorrow. That our Will is unbroken, that we refuse to kneel before the throne of the negro martyr or the semetic puppet. Stand. Stand for you are European. Stand for you are my brother, for the brothers that are watching. I, they, need to see strength.</div>

If so then cease reading for you are as worthless as a civic nationalist. *You* are the Man needed in this hour. *You* are the beacon for those seeking to resist need rally to. They do not merely need your words. They needs your actions. I make this effort here so you may realise this, that you may be something worthy of those who fell so that you may live. This epoch is dying, America, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, name the European nation and you will see it in it's death throes. Men of strength, Men with ideals are what is needed in this coming darkness. Men who do not merely operate within the mediocre tedium of "democracy" but Men of vision, Men of integrity. That, that is you. It is not destiny nor fate, it is your blood that demands it, hear it's cries, hear it's voice. It is the voice the chides you when you fall to degeneration, it is the voice that despite the darkest of hours forces you to awaken in the morning, it is the voice that you hear when enraged at the vile injustices done to our people by the semetic filth. That is the true you, the you that understands right from wrong, that imbues you with a sense of justice and nobility. That lifts you from the mundane cowardice of the masses to the insensate rage at the atrocities inflicted upon us. Your duty is clear. Your heart is strong. Your souls voice clears. Listen to it. Listen to it telling you, shouting at you to listen. Let us stand, let us fight. Not merely for political principles but for our very people. Let us show them Men still live, Men still stand even in the darkest of hours.<br><br>Until victory be won.</div>

You want to see examples of people who have made fools of themselves? Check <a href="/endpolmeta/">&gt;&gt;&gt;/endpolmeta/</a> the archive for deletions from /pol/. You always come across as the most eloquent among us here. It is honestly very convincing, these words you have used to bring about a rise in spirit. Do not fear death. Do not wait for the new Hitler. Yes. Though Hitler succeeded much better than any ever have in the past, he eventually met both defeat and death. As do we all. The fact that men barely past middle-age die on at least a weekly basis brings that clarity more to light. We're all going to die. The question is whether you want your end to be complete organ failure in a hospital bed after you've long been too decrepit to succeed in your dreams, or if you're willing to risk losing that insane discomfort <strong>right now</strong>, not only risking your life but your livelihood. The jews will try their best to ruin your whole career. These parasites whom have been cast-out for centuries over 200 times are now casting people out in their own nations. The problem in history has always been letting the kike-roaches back in. The problem with spokesmen and spokewomen against the jew has always been that they were not heavy-handed enough, lacked integrity and submitted to their jewish overlords or grew too weak and sick <span class="spoiler">say if the jewishness of a doctor is completely ignored as he slowly poisons you</span> that they have failed every time. The failure is not always due to lack of integrity. That's half of the problem. Capitulation. Submitting, permitting jews to get away with it. That is the major issue across all of our nations.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">To fall into despair is such a quiet thing is it not. To let yourself drift into your own shadow, to let the loathing and hatred of this age take you. It is a quiet thing, a lonely thing. The misery grips you, the shadows of yesterday pulling at you, blackened claws pulling you down, down into yourself and the darkness within. Tis' indeed a foul thing indeed. You lose yourself, you lose sight of what matters, what is important, you forget who you are. You bind yourself in chains, a prisoner to your own sorrows and regrets. The topic of today is simply this; that freedom for ourselves can only be achieved by ourselves.<br><br>Tell me dear friends, how many of you have suffered or suffer currently in this age of madness and chaos. How many of you stare in the mirror nary comprehending the man before you. He is but a stranger, a remnant of the whole you. In previous topics I covered the ailments of this age, alcohol, pornography, self loathing, many a shadow come from these. In today's topic I choose to focus on the other part that drags the soul to become merely an ember in place of a raging inferno, that of resolving the memories of the past. Letting go of the chains that shackle the soul to darkness and finding resolution. One would be a liar were he to claim he had no regrets, no ghosts that haunt him still. Betrayals and abandonment by those we trusted, being left alone upon the rocky shores of this world to stand alone against the tide. Mistakes made, trusting those unworthy of our trust. We have, all of us, been affected by such things. Oh, we can blame outside sources, we can claim any number of reasons for what we hang on too, many of them likely true, but it is the coming to terms with such events that we must learn to do. Tell me, if you were to jump a gaping chasm to safety would you bind your ankles before the jump? If a friend were suffering and you sought to relieve their pain would you pass unto them your own? No, no of course not. It is the things that haunt us we must free ourselves from, that we must bring to a close. It is the ghosts of the past we must excorcise from ourselves if we are to stand tall, we are the arbiters of our own fate in this way. Do we face suppression for our words, our thoughts, most certainly, we are Men against time, against a system that would have kneel in subjugation to it, that would have us engorge ourselves on every vice known in order to alleviate our pains and our sadness', becoming hollow men akin to those who live vicariously through all forms of modern diseased media and product. But we are not them. We are not those who sit for hours on end, indulging ourselves in every distraction and whim, we are not those who poison our minds and our bodies with cheap chemical laden goods, we are Men who stand defiant to such things, Men who hear the call of something greater, in our blood, in our hearts, in our souls. We are outsiders one and all. Thusly if we are to restore sanity to this world, if we are to become the beacons we are needed to be then we must not merely come to embrace our values and represent them but be able to dispel the darkness within us that holds us back.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">To be betrayed, to be abandoned by those you trust is a harsh thing, a lesson in cruelty inflicted by the malicious and the cowardly. To suffer loss, heart ache, sadness at our past is a natural thing for life is a hard mistress is it not. It teaches us not with a kind caress but with a barbed whip, the lashes leaving scars in the flesh of the spirit and like open wounds they must be treated, the wound cleaned and closed so it can heal. To forget, no, to move past transgressions against us is of paramount importance. To know when to say goodbye to the things that haunt us, that occasionally rise in dark moments and grip us, is vital to becoming the Men we wish to be. To forget is not merely enough, to move beyond it, to come to terms with these events, no matter how hard, is what is needed. It can be difficult, tremendously so, some wounds are deep, shards of the past surface and stifle us, the walls of memory enclosing in and trapping us in the moment again and again, forcing who we are down and bringing the walls we built to resist the corrosion of this age against ourselves, we in turn become our own worst enemy. We become warped creatures, in place of past events shaping us for the better we become misshapen parodies of ourselves, a walking, talking simulacrum of the person we are meant to be. A hollow man not too dissimilar to those who partake in the degeneracy of this epoch, only in place of hedonistic pleasure it is the pain of memory.<br><br>To vanquish such a thing is no easy task. It takes courage, strength, the Will to do so and as in all things related to fighting for a greater cause such things must start with ourselves. I too found myself lost in recent times. I had become despondent, hopeless, merely operating on basic functions, my soul silent, my heart empty. I had lost myself. But I was reminded that it need not be that way by someone important to me. That the sorrows of before can be defeated, that to live vicariously through others is not living but merely existing. That if we are to be true to ourselves, true to our ideals and our dreams we must become the Men we once were, the Men we are and the Men we will be. If we are to do this we must break our own chains for if we were to fail, if we were to remain hollow then our dreams, our aspirations, our hopes would wither and die with us. But how do we do so, how to do we confront that which haunts us so? By allowing us to feel these moments, by working through them. It is not a painless process. It will test you. Maybe even break a part of you. But if we do not, if we do not find the strength to let the past wash over us like water then it will haunt us, our mistakes, our choices, our personal history forever holding sway over who we become, shaping us in ways that twist us beyond who we are.</div>

  <div class="divMessage">So much is against us. Money. Power. Press. All the material powers are against us. To stand against such a thing requires courage, heroism this age has never known. If we are to stand true, if we are to fight this coming night then we must steel our spirit not merely to face this but to face ourselves. To break the chains that bind us to our own sorrows so that hope can rise again in our hearts, so that those who would call us brother, father, their love, know we will not buckle nor bend, that we stand true at their backs, unyielding in the face of an uncertain tomorrow. Now, more than ever, are Men of strength needed. Now more than ever are those with Wills unbroken, with the bravery to dream are needed. You are needed. So stand not simply for your people, not simply for your blood but yourself as well. A cracked bulwark is of little protection for it's flaws can be exploited. But an unbroken wall of Faith, of Resolution, of Will, that cannot be broken. It holds against the tide, it turns the blades struck against it, it holds firm against all the blows upon it. You and I are that bulwark. We are that wall upon which the tides of this age crash against, we are those who stand defiant against the coming night. All around us things fall to ruin, all around us is fear of tomorrow and what it brings. It is to us that those we care for will look to, it is to us those lost in the shadows will flock to, will we be found wanting, will we be found weakened, will we be found flawed and broken? No I say, no we will not, we cannot be. We each stand for our own reasons, each of us stand for Christ, for Woden, for the Men who inspired us, for our families, for our dreams of a better tomorrow, mayhaps a mix of all these things. But such a stand, such a defiance will only be as strong as ourselves. The Will within us must endure and only by facing our own darkness can such a strength be found. By an act of Will shall we be made whole. By an act of Will shall we find ourselves again and earn the right to stand at each others side, unbroken and unyielding. By an act of Will will tomorrow be made in the image of hope and our dreams made manifest. I ask you not to stand for me. Not merely to stand for those who inspire you. I ask you to stand for you. So that the ideals you hold can be bought forward, so that together we can forge a tomorrow worthy of our people. So that the dream of peace, of freedom, can be ours once more.</div>

But if you have a job say 8 hours a day (to afford bills) requiring 7 hours of sleep, do you even exercise the remaining time? If you're not yet 35 when metabolisms begin to slow or have a shitty metabolism, you'll have to dedicate time for that and a social life. Kikes want you distracted from both so you're more easily compliant. The point is - breed with your own kind. Have a relationship with your same race. Stay fit. If vidya doesn't allow that, stop the games.</div>

The penalties of many laws exist of course as deterrents to prevent society from devolving into chaos. However, there are "hate speech" laws throughout Europe and focused on by the DHS which only proves kikes' overwhelming control of worldwide politics. If you want to break laws and risk being subjected to imprisonment, that's always your choice. Personally, I'm pissed I can't move to the lands of my Aryan ancestors without risking getting locked up for speaking my mind or you know: murdered by packs of Arabs or African migrant niggers because jews incentivized their immigration.</div>

National Socialists are the most Wanted and hated idealists out there. I also live in the US of Zionists. Cops aren't Gestapo with a sense of cultural pride and heritage. Modern police have only mob mentality as the blue mafia and they work for international jewry penalizing anyone spreading truth against kikes as Antifa are free to vandalize. Fuck them. Why do you want to be arrested so badly? Niggers will be in prison waiting for fresh meat.</div>

"Master race" and all that bullshit.<br><br>I don't know why you're still ranting about not following the law when I answered. Not all laws are right and many exist as deterrents to prevent chaos.

Try to absorb replies so you don't end up some dumbass public shooting a bunch of niggers when there are 1.1 billion plus negroes on planet Earth and niggers kill each other far more than you ever could.<br><br>You can't break the law and kill off all negroes or all jews by yourself.

  <div class="divMessage">So, for a time I came here to offer what I could of what I learned, from friends, from those sharing our struggle, from my own experiences and the experiences of others. /Sig/ has always been the missing component from our people in this age of misery. Now however, I come as a supplicant. I mentioned the loss of a loved one previously, this loss has been exacerbated by a greater situation, one that has stripped me of my purpose. <br><br>One of the driving forces in my life has always been my son. Everything I did, every word, every ideal, was inspired by my drive to give him the future he deserves, that all our children deserve, that our people have earned through countless trials and tribulations. I lost him. Not to death nor has his mother taking him but rather a malady that has afflicted him since a young age has fully claimed his mind. I knew it was coming, for the last few years I could see the changes but now he is lost to me truly. I have grieved, little by little, tried to force myself to continue my pursuit of a future for him even knowing it was a dream that grew more distant by the day. Even as it claimed him I kept going, affecting all I wrote, you may of even noticed, a theme in my later posts of combating depression, despair. In hindsight it would not be unfair to say a great many of my posts were not just for inspiring all who follow us but the words a father would give to a son whom he loves and fought for, reflecting on events and situations as they arose. A light to follow for those who need it and for myself. Now that fire that drove me is extinguished and I am left adrift. Every word written, every thought, every ideal I tried to put to paper since his mind fully collapsed has felt empty for they are. I am empty. I look at what I write and feel nothing, I refuse to feel anything. Emotion overwhelms and I cannot move past it. I want to weep. I sit here on a beautiful grassy hill under a vast blue sky and all I feel is hollow. This emptiness even led me to push away my love, his mother and our relationship lays in limbo, a mix of her inability to handle the situation with our son and a number of foolish actions in my depression led to a schism thus she left, my son remaining with me in his mentally broken state. I love her, truly I do yet I do not know if that love remains in her heart for me.<br><br>I need purpose in my life again, this I know. Yet I cannot find it. I have no career to speak of, dedicating myself to his care these last few years. I have no family nor friends for I left those in the city of my birth. I am reduced, a man in his mid thirties, carer for an son broken by a fluke of biology whose mind is nought but anger, devolved in many ways from who he used to be. I want to fight. I want to keep going, I know I need to. Yet all I can do is struggle not to collapse. I have spent my life giving, giving all of myself I could yet all I feel is failure. Failure that I could not save my son from what ails him. Failure at my inability to help my people. Failure for my weakness. I am spent and I do not even know who I am, I haven't for a while. I do not know why I even write this, a lament, words to the void? A final clawing grasp to hold onto something? I do not know. <br><br>Please. Can anyone help me.</div>

I have felt very little for a long time, so I can sympathize. Though this is not about me, it's just to say we all have our grief to bare through. I didn't want to start this reply with "Well, you're English" and have it misconstrued. This is why I had the desire to say that: North America. Yes it is a miserable, obnoxious mixing pot hellhole of a place. However, you're English. You no doubt have some experience. In this land simply with your accent, you would have promotions more open to you and women fawning for that reason. I've seen it happen many times. Should you consider it, some things you should avoid are the southern regions of major cities, the far east and the deep south. Should you find yourself under the boot of 'African Americans' or Hispanics in charge, you would face the same discrimination the left likes to claim "only happens to white people".<br><br>Keep in mind, the USA is a mass immigration pile of shit. Also, as someone who works in the system of American health care - do not subject your son to that money pit should you travel here. With exorbitant medical costs, you could afford yachts for the same prices.</div>

Many situations can be found pleasurable that aren't degenerate. The "I'm better than you thing"? Yeah, that's the ego selfish psychological mind control since (((Freud))). You should not behave as the modern concept of "you". Instead, think of yourself as your people. That too (((they))) claim as racist while they'll immediately turn around and believe the same thing about their own. Placing a priority on your people doesn't mean you have to hate every other race but yours. Only the singular race that spreads the propaganda causing other races to hate yours. Ours.

The original Greek in that verse you mentioned is œÄŒªŒµŒøŒΩŒµŒæ·Ω∑Œ± (pleonexia) meaning grasping, overreaching and avarice. Only a wealthy man is told to give away his possessions in Matthew 19:21.

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#89959">&gt;&gt;89959</a><br>I sympathize. My thoughts go out to you at this difficult time. This is the first time I post a message here, although I have read your contributions on this thread for years where you have given us so much. From the bottom of my heart, thank you BritAnon. I feel the shame in my bones for having done so little of all your advice. I regret the life I led, the way I used my time, the fact that I have so little to give to those I love. If you need a shoulder to cry on and console you, and tens of thousands of miles did not separate us, and in case you will forgive me for being only what I am, then in my arms ! If you need hope for your beloved son, nothing else comes to mind than the remote possibility that the application of Dr. Hamer's work could have a possible impact. Research about him, his story, how he was persecuted and understand his vision of medicine. It shouldn't take long with your intellect. Several times I preferred to rely on his vision of medicine for some health problems that were quite worrying at the time, with success. In case it's in vain... I don't know what to tell you. Jesus?<br><br>Good luck my dear.</div>

Incontinenza, incontinence, a lack of self-restraint with knowledge it is bad is not punished within the city of Dis according to Dante. The man was clearly insane. His enemies who exiled him ended up in his elaborate torture fiction known as l'Inferno. Whether you're Christian or not, there is no Hell. The Catholic church took a concept already blown out of proportion and ran with it. The lake of fire is literally a lake of fire. The weeping and gnashing of teeth is a response to being thrown into molten lava. Gehenna was literally a burning heap where kikes sacrificed children. Dante was the one behind the modern perception of Purgatory. The bible, the book you should be paying attention to over men preaching, states that with the first resurrection, the second death has no power. The second resurrection is the second death which is: a second death.<br><br>Think about losing your brain which stores thoughts and memories. Becoming a disembodied entity that knows nothing, remembers nothing. You should fear the permanent void far more than thinking a loving God would cause ethereal spirits to suffer for all eternity. Especially suicides. Turned into trees with branches torn at by harpies for eternity? The successful at suicide aren't even wicked. They were merely either depressed or went out on their own terms in facing a terrible choice. Now, you could resort to listing modern translations of verses that deviate from the original Greek but really, it's a very common delusion because of mistranslations.</div>

We don't detox from it in the first place. Our very nature is to seek out because no matter how hard human beings try to pretend we're advanced: <strong>we are animals</strong>. That tendency to seek dopamine is your natural instinct. It is <em>meant</em> for pursuing food, water and shelter. Goals. With all of these needs met, we are ripe for manipulation. Those dopamine rewards now are the next iPhone, the next car, the next sexual conquest, the next random bullshit for status. There are many outliers, people on the fringes of society that do not want to accept the corporate slavery or the disgusting degeneracy. These are who video games accomplish to distract. Even moreso than jewish ran mainstream media for the majority which are fucking imbeciles. Woke agendas are put into games badly. They are not effective. Influence is not the strategy there. It's preoccupation. The escapism of constantly seeking rewards for one's efforts. Every single puzzle piece that keeps people from once again rising against the jewish overlords is a plot by the fucking kikes.</div>

It is by majority fraud and false personas now as corporate overlords want service with a fake smile. Introverts are pressured by the extroverts to be as obnoxious as them, even though those extroverts can't possibly understand how impossible that is. So when they force fake personalities, they create shallow sociopaths. There's no point to the social parties of modern degenerates, as they're going to spend the majority of their adult lives pretending they have "friends" when it's mostly the distance of ((social media)) and the butt-kissing of corrupt management by cowardly coworkers.<br><br>What to do with the issue? National Socialism was the reality of happiness over fraud personalities. Since that will never rise again against ZOG's worldwide grip, I suppose all that's left is to lament.</div>

  <div class="divMessage"><a class="quoteLink" href="/pol/res/70828.html#90472">&gt;&gt;90472</a><br>Here are a few subjects I have noticed. Possibly pieces of a larger puzzle. I know when Columbus (Colon) set sail. I know he was fleeing Spain's Alhambra Decree. There is no doubt in my mind his fleet where boatloads of jews. So riddle me this. Why did so many early settlers have kike names but are constantly referenced as Christians in somewhat modern texts?<br><strong>Men</strong>: Obadiah. Jeremiah. Abraham. Jericho. Amos. Zachariah. Bartholomew. Benjamin, Joseph etc.<br><strong>Women</strong>: Delilah, Ezra, Esther, Sarah, Josephine, Susannah, etc.<br>My point is, old Americans had VERY suspicious names. I think jewish blood mixture is far more infecting the population than the claim of over 15 million by general census. This melting pot pile of shit may have been pre-modern Israel 2.0 while the Native Americans where slaughtered and land stolen by those jewish invaders much the same as modern Israeli invaders of Palestine are slaughtering Palestinians and stealing their land. Yet in schools we're taught "bad white people". In school I was also taught the kike holocaust which later was discovered to be a fraud perpetrated by lying jews. More "coincidence".</div>

Remove jews from the equation and we may take back our lands plus expel jews again. The one thing we were lacking when over 200 times kikes were expelled was space travel.

It seems to work better - but then I'll be more "cold" to people and burn bridges in many cases.</div>

Otherwise, dressing up is for job interviews or to impress a first date. When I read messages like yours, my mind instantly works like a highlighter. Racial situations pop out to me. Like the fact you were making <em>focaccia</em> and it was just your <em>family</em> complaining about being overdressed. Of course also that you were rejected by a <strong>head kike band leader</strong>. Well, you're most likely Italian. Correct me if I'm wrong if you're just making specific Italian bread for no blood reason. Italian families are critical of each other.

Having ADHD plus being analytical and empirical means your mind <em>should</em> have extreme trouble absorbing information you don't care about. This is an issue in a University of course because of all the absolute bullshit they try to force you to learn which will have zero bearing in any aspect of your life. Whatever you learn that has a real life application, you might absorb. Otherwise, it's chaff. Waste. Pointless crap anywhere else but required in the particular course. You don't have to <em>not</em> be artistic or poetic when you have that affliction. I don't know how to tell you to get along with a family that has these qualities. There isn't enough information.</div>

Except for a "Karen" type I guess. Young women are instantly promoted in my career path on hire yet experienced men aren't promoted any more. Women have it so fucking easy now. If they want instant money better than being the obnoxious girl boss nagging cunt, all they have to do is show cleavage on cam for simps. If they want even more money, they show their nudity and degenerate acts on OnlyFans. That extra opportunity is only open for men if they're faggots.</div>

The problem is that for every 1,000 jobs (non-metaphorical number) they apply, they only get 1 or 2 replies. I'm currently trying to expand my actual business (which provides services for companies), but many cities have companies that are downsizing. <br><br>If you want to help white men (and/or illegal hispanics), do things via sub-contracts or day laboring. Many white men are hard workers but CANNOT afford taxes, or the child support they often shoulder. This is why I use everyone as day laborers: Illegals shroud white men (John Doe is actually Jose Martinez on paper, met him with other immigrants in the corner); white men shroud illegals (this white man with papers is representative of my work force).<br><br>Aside from helping white men work without much paperwork (LEGALLY it is their responsibility if they are day laborers, and/or earning less than $12K/yearly), their day laborer status allows them to use any name. This means, they can choose to work under the table if they decide to.</div>

Day labor and working with illegal Mexicans. 12 hour shifts or more. The hot sun baring down on them. There's a difference between high-end and dead-end. Any white man is better off with two jobs in retail, as shitty as this second option is. Or you know, education for a better position. Corporate doesn't care about employees so no A/C (or lying their asses off saying it's broken until they visit and A/C magically works). There's the same heat without sunburn. Yes, also surrounded by women with women in charge. Contractors in charge can be just as nagging, pretentious and fucking obnoxious. Men acting like women are somehow worse. I worked construction four years in my youth. I don't hate women more than illegal Mexicans. One stance I'm sure you're aware of National Socialists is we're against mass migration. That whole scene doesn't seem worth it at all.<br><br>Lately, there have been a few posts suggesting welcoming Mexicans or "The Hispanic Empire was based" shilling with pro-shitskin cartoons. Seems suspicious.</div>

I have been forced to work with them for over two decades. The speed at which bullshit flies from their mouths is unbelievable. No system of honor whatsoever. It's not in their blood or heritage. Human sacrifice is. Bloodletting is. They talk shit behind everyone's back. They gaslight conversations as badly as jews. They shoot each other in the south sides of every city they live. The men are tough surrounded with their cholo friends but apologizing cowards when they're alone. The women have extreme OCD to the point nothing anyone does is ever right.

I said the majority of modern Spaniards are white and brown skins are insane. To this day, Caucasians are blamed by Native Americans as "the evil white man took our land". Yet Colon whose name resembles an asshole "coincidentally" fled Spain at the very same time jews were exiled. It's along the same deception as blaming us for the Tran Atlantic slave trade ran by jews who owned the ships, ports and sold negros in newspapers.<br><br>Everything the jew did is said to be our fault because their lies always focus on shifting blame away from them.</div>

Other people (like the Chinese and Leif Erikson) failed in recognizing America as a new land AND disclosing it to others.<br>Sources from Spaniards:<br>1) <span class="youtube_wrapper">https://youtube.com/watch?v=PPxIizj1uLQ [<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=PPxIizj1uLQ">Embed</a>]</span> <br>2) <span class="youtube_wrapper">https://youtube.com/watch?v=aC4kM2CexDk [<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aC4kM2CexDk">Embed</a>]</span><br>3) <span class="youtube_wrapper">https://youtube.com/watch?v=IEQBRrx8wRY [<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=IEQBRrx8wRY">Embed</a>]</span><br><br>The founding of America was a LEGAL process that started in 1493 with Inter Caetera and continued with other legal documents such as the Last Will of Queen Isabel and the Translatio Imperii of the Inca. In fact, one of the titles of the King of Spain is Inca (even his wiki has it).<br><br>In Spain we have the Archive of Indies, which addressed the stories about Colon "being jewish", "looking for spices", or that he was "running away"... they are just stories that NO DOCUMENT backs up. Colon was an Hispanic man, who served the Hispanic Monarchy, and was tasked to discover new people and routes in order to pincer attack the Muslims. Authors like Gustavo Bueno and Elvira Roca Barrea have written and spoken about this.<br><br><span class="greenText">&gt;Caucasians are blamed by Native Americans as "the evil white man took our land"</span><br>Non-Hispanics did that. Native Americans were Spaniards in the Hispanic Empire, and they had MORE rights than Europeans. In fact, ALL Native Americans could write to the Hispanic Monarch, such as Enriquillo: A cacique turned terrorist for money, then turned to loyal subject again.<br><br>Another example is Don Francisco de Arobe, a black immigrant who became governor in America. The list of Hispanic magnanimity goes on forever, which is how the world knew world peace for +300 years.</div>

Land somewhere, declare it new land despite inhabitants, then say it's legally new. I don't know how you take such a statement seriously.

There is a document.<br><br><span class="greenText">&gt;<em>Caucasians are blamed by Native Americans as "the evil white man took our land" </em></span><br><span class="greenText">&gt;Non-Hispanics did that.</span><br>Yeah. Because Native Americans migrated from northeast Asia and Siberia through the Bering land bridge. There's another funny claim beaners love to make in Texas. "If you don't mind Native Americans" (they're well aware I don't) "why don't you get along with us?". Because they're NOT. They were <strong>Spain's bitch</strong> and nothing more. Now, I may not mind the Asian and Siberian Native Americans, but they are still insane. They're the ones whom consistently blame "the white man" along with kikes who think they're clever. They (NAs) slaughtered their own for centuries before Colon the jewish asshole arrived and claimed it India. Violent rival tribes wiped others out. Modern day, the only Native Americans I have met lose their minds and kill themselves or drink themselves into a stupor. Always ranting about the white man. It's not like I blame <em>them</em>. They're too blind to tell the difference between Caucasians and not quite white skin. Again, just like the negroes and the Trans Atlantic slave trade blaming the white man.<br><br>Serious question time. Why, when I brought up the fact Spain is majority white, did you resort to saying BLOOD LIBELS, SLANDERS and that Native Castilians plus Native Americans had more rights? Is white supremacy something you believe exists? Yes, I'm poking and prodding. I'm just trying to figure out <em>what you are</em> after you started this with "Anglo-Saxons Satanic hegemony".</div>

That's what triple brackets are meant for. <strong>Actual kikes</strong>. To label non jews this way is division. To suggest someone very much may have been a jew because they loved everything jewish is different.</div>

Note I say Christendom, not Christ. Christ much like the older Gods of our people remains true and shall forever remain true. But Christendom has fallen to corruption by and large. The second harsh truth is that despite it's success National Socialism and Fascism have also both fallen. Despite it's effectiveness and ideals, much like Christianity it too has become subverted with the lunatic and the degenerate claiming it's symbols as their own be it in the "Neo Nazi" Jewish invented ethos or the tragically pathetic "Black Metal" scene who co opted it's symbolism for "edgy" visuals.</span><br>So when you say "Christendom" (or National Socialism) "has failed", you just mean this current _generation_ of it has failed? Just to help out, you may want to rephrase that or you may sound a bit big-nosed. It would be more accurate to say that this current generation of those things has failed (it hasn't, there are still survivors who haven't fallen for (all of) (((their))) corruption or subversion, imperfect beings though we all be), rather than the ideologies themselves have failed.<br><br><span class="greenText">&gt;"ignore the other semetic texts within it that countermand the New Testamant viewpoints"</span><br><br>Excuse me wat<br>No seriously, what texts?

I hope Sat*n and his demons at least burn in hell for eternity (and maybe scum like the (((Rothschilds))) and their black mail rings (though nowhere near as badly as Sat*n), since they seem to want to burn in hell so badly instead of repent and turn to Jesus).<br>Also, I'm pretty sure those children sacrificed to S*t*n by those (((shitstains))) went to heaven (the children, not the monsters who did that obviously), there's very strong theological evidence in the Bible that "You will be judged according to what you know". Like when the Israelites were too afraid to take on Jericho, God judged their children as innocent, saying that they would enter the land of Israel, but that the older generation would all die in the desert.</div>

So I can tell you a few things according to Christianity. Spirits are eternal unless destroyed by God because He has the power to blot out names from the Book of Life. How that happens I've already covered - the lake of fire. The problem is how we are modernized to think of souls as : translucent, transparent, intangible. <em>The soul is the body animated by God's breath which is the spirit</em> (Genesis2)/(Job 33). The meaning of the first (saved) and second (condemned) resurrections of Revelation is that bodies will be brought back. Whole. It is said that those of the first resurrection will be granted the abilities of angels. I recommend Revelation. Dark, grim stuff sure, also condemning the modern Catholic church very specifically but especially about those who are not Judean. Keeping in mind even the first translation into English of the King James Version defaults Judeans to jews when it's not in the original Greek. Those who say they're Judean and are not is pretty clear who they are. Those who stole the claim of Israel.</div>

Odinists are our brothers of history. Though I have taken issue against a pretend Asatru who once posted here acting like those ancient battles of slain vikings by Christians were "Bad". That fool shat on Christianity <span class="spoiler">and was banned for it</span> Vikings fought and died gladly to be sent to Valholl. They invaded monasteries for gold. They slaughtered just the same as Christians did of Pagans. Pretending one side was worse is insanity. Their leaders converted to Christianity authentically, unlike jews as <em>Conversos</em> who only pretended to so they could tear it down from within. Those viking Scandinavians became the Crusaders. Christian warriors (((modern historians))) love to shit on for doing the exact same things every past society has ever done. Jews will set us against each other, as I'm sure you know with the religion of Islam. Allah as their god. Even though, unlike kikes, Arabs recognize Jesus as a great prophet.<br><br>There are only two reasons visitors are anti Christian or anti Arab when they come here to follow well known jewish tendencies. Either they're jew themselves or they're influenced by the centuries-old jewish mentality of hating Jesus or Arabs. Ignoring the evils of Judaism and religion bating is no different than race baiting. It's all jewish divide tactics.</div>

The dredges of society tend to think we're insane whenever we reveal the evils of jews, calling them by name. Like a lifetime brainwashed Pavlovian response. So to be "sane" like those dimwitted sheep? The same who fill Trump rallies for Israel and the Left believes every fake atrocity against kikes even though they're now aware of real Israeli atrocities. According to those imbeciles, I'm insane.

  <div class="divMessage">I have been a parent of a blonde, blue eyed daughter for five years. I work extremely hard, but have not obtained the material rewards my boomer parents and in laws said I would. I have grown relatively physically fit, with a home gym, and my wife and child are loyal, loving, and well disciplined. Spiritually, I am extremely rich, and socially I am moderately wealthy, but materially... <br>I don't think Truthseekers can honestly earn enough to make a home anymore. Instead I am taking care of my aged parents and working for the land to be developed so that when they may perish, hopefully not for some time, my wife and daughter and I may inherit the homestead. I am training my daughter in my faith, and teaching her naturalism, the sciences, pragmatism, and philosophies of the National Socialists. <br>Still, I can't help but wonder if all that will be enough when the gates of Western Civilization collapse for the last time. I can only do my very best to prepare the ladies for it. <br>My stacks of bullets and defensive cache of guns, even in the natural fortress in the Southern Wood which I am creating will keep us safe from attack, but what of folly? <br>I can only do my best to raise my family lionistically from the perverse attachment and degeneracy of the modern world. I was not born into wealth, and have never seen it.Luckily, I had the choice to struggle for everything fine I have ever been gifted by the divine. I was born into freedom, however, and I chose Hitler and Sikhi to be my masters and guide my family to purity and strength. <br>I can only do my best, whether it be good enough or not to destroy the Kali Yuga. I will protect my family, my people, and live for Truth. <br>We must secure an existence for White People and a Future for White Children, and I will do as much as I am able to do just that. <br>Heil the Gurus, Heil the Truth, Heil the White Race, and Heil Hitler.</div>
